Paper idea is to\r\n use a variety of asymmetric encryption strategies, particularly group encr\r\nyption, that are aligned to the intra- and inter-zones of the ZRP protocol\r\n. However, the writing style likely masks the paper’s contributi\r\nons. The paper promises a lot but waits until page 4 to explain its contri\r\nbutions and then lacks room to quantitatively describe its potential benefi\r\nt. \r\n\r\nThe protocol at first blush appears to be susceptible to various traffic an\r\nalysis threats. For example, the paper includes a timestamp such that mess\r\nages are rejected if it is “invalid.” However, what makes \r\nthe timestamp invalid is not defined. Timestamps are inherently risk in cy\r\nber and provide opportunities for rushing attacks and replay. The timestam\r\nps appear to be sent in the clear providing a clear marker that can be used\r\n to trace packets as well as perform traffic analysis. \r\n\r\nCleaning up the writing style will significantly improve readership and pro\r\nvide additional room that can be used to expand on the paper’s cent\r\nral innovations. Pay particular attention to passive voice and extra words\r\n (e.g.” In order to illustrate clearly as in Fig. 1 an example of m\r\nilitary application is as follows” may be written as “Consi\r\nder the following example.”). Some sentences do not make sense. (e\r\n.g. “One can figure out that military units could possibly be ke\r\npt tracking by adversary attacks with different types of nodes.”) M\r\noreover, it is difficult to understand some of the author’s definit\r\nions. For example, typically, insiders are directly participating in the \r\nMANET and may provide data forwarding services. Outsiders are not particip\r\nating in the MANET but attempt to infer MANET details from observed traffic\r\n. \r\n\r\nBreaking down the three core claims of that the paper addresses: \r\n\r\nVulnerabilities of existing protocols: Weak. Little new insight. Clarity i\r\ns a problem. \r\n\r\nDefine and characterize SEAZOR: Introduce late (page 4). The protocol desc\r\nription summarized in Figure 3 is a good start. But there are inconsistenc\r\nies between the text and the notation (e.g. PK_tempo which this reviewer ca\r\nnnot find in the table of definitions or figure). Again clarity may be un\r\ndermining the value of the work. \r\n\r\nDemonstrate benefits of SEAZOR over other: At best, the comparison is qual\r\nitative and lacks quantitate results demonstrating the strengths and weakne\r\nsses compared to other approaches. No attention is given to the signaling \r\noverhead of the additional encryption mechanisms on overall system performa\r\nnce. Node mobility, which changes zone membership is also not examined. W\r\nith encryption-based techniques, protocols are susceptible to assymetric re\r\nsource consumption attacks. Under these attacks, the adversary can easily \r\ngenerate a “bad” stream of traffic. Nodes are forced to pe\r\nrform CPU intensive crypto algorithms on this data stream that results in l\r\nower throughput. \r\n\r\n> *** Technical Contribution: Rate the content based on its technical stren\r\ngth. \r\nMarginal - Simple contribution with some flaws (2) \r\n\r\n> *** Advancing Technologies / State-of-the-Art: Rate the novelty or contri\r\nbution to military communications. \r\nSome new concepts (3) \r\n\r\n> *** Relevance and Timeliness: Rate the relevance of the topic and the imp\r\nortance to military communication applications. \r\nRelevant (4) \r\n\r\n> *** Quality of Presentation: Rate the organization and readability of the\r\n paper. \r\nNeeds work (2) \r\n\r\n> *** Accept/Reject Recommendation: Do you feel that this paper should be a\r\nccepted or rejected? \r\nReject (0) \r\n\r\n======= Review 3 ======= \r\n\r\n> *** Comments to Authors:: Please provide comments to the authors that exp\r\nlain your numerical ranking: \r\n\r\nThis paper studies the anonymous routing problem in ad hoc networks.

Weak aspects (Comments to the author: what are the weak aspects of the paper?)\r\nThis paper is very long and wordy especially in the first part. Moreover a lot of grammatical errors and typos are present in all the paper. The whole presentation should be improved. The problem studied has been extensively investigated in cognitive radio literature, although authors use a different framework with industrial wireless sensor networks. Problem P1 is non convex, as well as P2. But in Section 4 authors introduce two new variables, y and z, and then they can apply an algorithm in the dual domain to design an heuristic. This crucial change of variables (not even defined) is not explained at all, and therefore it is difficult to follow.\r\n3. Recommended changes (Recommended changes.

Strong aspects (Comments to the author: what are the strong aspects of the paper)\r\nThe paper jointly solves the power control and channel uncertainty problems in cognitive radio sensor networks. The channel uncertainty is modeled as a bound range of values called the uncertainty region. These uncertainty regions are integrated into the optimization problem which calculate the allocated power for each secondary user. This idea is interesting and original.\r\n2. Weak aspects (Comments to the author: what are the weak aspects of the paper?)\r\nHowever, the paper is not well written. There are many incoherent points in terms of notation used by the text and the ones used by the equations making the paper very difficult to understand and follow. In addition, there are many english errors and typos in the whole paper. Problem of notation: Page 2, section II.A, h(i,j) is used to denote the channel gain in the text while Equation 1 uses g(i) without any explainaion. Figures 1 and 2 are not explicitly cited and explained in the text. There is not secondary users in Figure 2 and I cannot find the text explaining this figure because the figure number is not explicitly mentioned in the text. The same problem of incoherence can be found between the text and Equation (2) in page 3. The same problem of incoherence of notation continues in section IV. In section V, the paper said that the simulation parameters are presented in Table 1 while there is not Table I in the paper.\r\n3. Recommended changes (Recommended changes.

Some notations (e.g., $g_i$, $h^{ss}_{ii}$, C1, C2, ..) are explained while some redundant ones (e.g., $G^{ss}_{i,0}$) are presented. Therefore, it is difficult to the reader to track. Specially, there is no connection between Problem (P2) (transmission power control) and equation (17) with the utility function.\r\n3. Recommended changes (Recommended changes.

The method is applicable to real-time distributed systems in which retransmission is not feasible. \r\nIn its present shape, unfortunately, I can’t recommend the paper for publication in IEEE Communications Letters. Here are some of my arguments \r\n1)  Lack of proper explanations and comparisons. Although error recovery is one of major problems in communications, it is not explained why the proposed method has advantages to any other method, like LDPC or BCH coding. For example, data which are correlated may be compressed and then used with lower rate, higher correction BCH codes, rather than to be approximated. Is it worse than Bezier approximation without compression? And then, approximation could still produce errors &#8211; what are error requirements, is this strategy viable? \r\n2)  Lack of specifics. It is not clear what sort of data is under study, and for what systems the methods can give advantage over other known methods. My guess is that approximation would be good for very smooth data, but modern video-formats are already compressed and may not fall into that category. The authors need to explain it clearly. \r\n3)  The subject is not very much relevant to Communications, in my opinion. A general reader may not be able to understand why this problem is of importance, and what applications could be. \r\n4)  Although there are comparisons in Section IV, they don’t give us clear conclusions. Would really like to see some comparisons between all known approximation methods to understand why Bezier method is the best. \r\n\r\n-------------------Review 4:\r\n\r\nThe paper proposes to shape the transmitted data using a Bezier curve. Then, when residual errors \r\nremain after classical FEC decoding, this approximation can be used to recover. The paper is well \r\nwritten with good English. \r\nHowever, the scientific justification for such a technique is not provided. In fact, by the provided elements in the paper, the results are not reproducible. Please provide a clear mathematical description on how the encoding and decoding process of the Bezier fitting is processed. The authors put more effort and space in the paper on the higher level algorithm and Handshaking rather than detailing the heart of the contribution related to the methodology of using the Bezier curve. In addition, some claims of the paper regarding existing error corecting codes are to be modified. If indeed BCH codes have a limited correcting capability, higher layer coding like Raptor codes and even \r\nfountain codes are comparable to the proposed system in terms of target functionality. Therefore, the paper should provide at least a justification or the advantages for choosing the proposed method rather than well established solutions. A comparison to this type of solutions would be a real plus. This comparison can target error rate performance and complexity. Typical comparison metrics for such coding schemes relies in comparing the performance in terms of bit error rates or frame error rates versus required parity or used parity and signal to noise ratio. This is not the metric used in the paper. Instead there is a measure of reliability in the paper without a mention of the type of errors and their distribution. Therefore, it is quite difficult to assess the performance of the proposed solution. No clear complexity comparison with respect to the before mentioned methods is provided. Therefore, once again it is quite difficult to assess such a proposal.\r\nAs a conclusion, without detailing the proposal at the transmitter and at the receiver side and without any comparison results in terms of performance and/or complexity with respect to existing methods, I find it difficult to accept the publication of the paper. \r\n\r\nThe remaining reviewers&#39; comments are attached.", "write_date": "2013-11-19T16:31:27Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.157", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 23, "fields": {"subject": "Agung - IEEE CL - Dynamic Rate Adaptation for IEEE 802.11g", "content": "Reviewer: 1\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe submitted paper deals with the topic of enhancing\r\nreliability and real-time capabilities of IEEE 802.11g wireless links in an industrial scenario. \r\nThough the addressed topic is of significant importance for enabling implementation\r\nof wireless extension of real-time ethernet segment, the paper does\r\nnot meet the required overall quality, lacks of scientificity and originality.\r\n\r\nDETAILS\r\n\r\nThe main concern with this work is that it seems more like a collage work from papers of others, rather than an original contribution of the authors. Indeed, any presented assumption throughout the paper is a reference to results presented in other works. The only apparently new result is the second table. However, the authors do not explain how this has been obtained, and no reference is provided. If this is an authors&#39; result, please state it clearly and explain how you got it. The whole work is based on the RA algorithm presented by ref. 6, and on the use of this table. The methodology is therefore questionable.\r\n\r\nI want also highlight that some figures appearing in the paper are actually copied by authors from some of the papers referenced in the bibliography, but without either explicit declaration or proper citation of the source of the figure,\r\n\r\nFrom a technical point of view, in many parts the paper adopt very strange/wrong assumptions,\r\nor introduce a reasoning without any context information.\r\nSome example:\r\n- it assumes a Rayleigh channel model, without referencing to other models\r\nand providing a very hasty justification.\r\n- authors state that random traffic has been generated. This shows that authors\r\nare not very confident with industrial network analysis, where typical traffic\r\nprofile and performance figures differ from those of general purpose IT networks.\r\n- authors considers legacy ARF (without any description) and SARF (proposed by ref. 6),\r\ndescribing why these should provide negative results with respect to their technique.\r\nThis description is however (at least) obscure.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the work results very confusing, difficult to read and understand. Given also the highly questionable originality of the paper, I cannot suggest its acceptance to the journal.\r\n\r\nFinally, a note on its presention quality.\r\nThe writing is very poor for a journal publication. There are plenty of orthographic\r\nand grammar mistakes. Some examples are:\r\n...arrival of packet will without error...  ...wass...  ...whcih...\r\n\r\nand many others.\r\nThe paragraph at mid second column of page 3 which starts with &#34;In SARF [...]&#34; is totally\r\nunintelligible, for example.\r\n\r\n \r\nReviewer: 2\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nComments to the Author\r\n\r\nThis paper proposes a new rate adaptation algorithm for IEEE 802.11g devices.\r\n\r\n===Originality and novelty===\r\n\r\nRate adaptation for legacy 802.11a/b/g networks is a heavily studied research field. There are multiple studies published for more than a decade. The authors did not compare their algorithm with state of the art algorithms like RRAA, SampleRate, MiRA, ESNR. They chose as their base of comparison ARF algorithm, which is among the oldest algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n===Technical quality and correctness===\r\n\r\nI did not find any new insight/contribution in this paper. All the results that authors claim are well known. The authors mainly focus on what they did rather than why they did it this way. There are also several open questions. Why your solution is for 802.11g? Why not for 802.11a/n? Why you compare your algorithm with ARF while earlier you describe SARF? Why there are no throughput evaluation results?\r\n\r\n===Presentation quality===\r\n\r\nPresentation needs some work, as there are several spellings and grammar mistakes. For example “ir will choose” in Section 3. Moreover some statements need to be more clear (e.g., “3.5 generations” in Section I).", "write_date": "2013-11-19T16:32:36Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.157", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 24, "fields": {"subject": "Agung - WiP ETFA2013 - Rate Adaptation", "content": "REVIEW 1\r\nThis paper proposes a method to optimize the rate adaptation in 802.11n WLANs. Even though it has a more or less clear structure in terms of sections, the contents of the sections are sometimes quite confusing. The style of writing and the grammar should be improved, e.g. abbreviations such as AMC, SARF, ACK, etc. must be introduced. The existing typos &#34;NSR - SNR&#34;, or &#34;QSPK - QPSK&#34; and several others must be removed.\r\n\r\nThe contribution of the paper is ambiguous and it is not clear how the proposed method really works. For instance, it is described in the abstract that the SNR values are transmitted by using ACK/BACK frames, but in the paper an explicit periodic exchange of this information is mentioned. The latter will add a lot of overhead to the wireless network which is not desired and should be avoided. The detailed explanation of Rayleigh fading does not contribute at all to the main objective of this work and should be only summarized. Moreover, it must be explained how the proposed values in table II were derived. The last paragraph in column 1 of page 3 is completely out of context, if I am not mistaken.\r\n\r\nFinally, the evaluation part of the paper is quite weak. The experiment to derive the results is not explained at all and the main essence of the obtained results is not clear to the reviewer. You should elaborate further on this. Fig. 1 must be improved, because it is hardly readable in the current version.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIEW 2\r\nThe algorithm presented by authors is a combination of classical RBAR algorithm simple predictor and a heuristic approach introduced in ARF like algorithms.\r\nIt&#39;s worth pointing out that none of them was mentioned in the paper. The proposed algorithm is based on the receiver based channel estimation which require a modification of the ACK frame and thus modification of the IEEE 802.11 standard. Despite authors claim it is not a trivial task. Additionally such a modification makes modified cards incompatible with of the shelf equipment.\r\nOne of the weak points of the algorithm is a heuristic used for the frame retransmission. Using such a simple retransmission pattern makes algorithm vulnerable to performance loss caused by inability to distinguish a reason of transmission failure especially in networks with higher collision probability (more than 5 stations).\r\nDespite the title the algorithm is rather addressed to the IEEE 802.11g networks. Almost nothing is known about the goal function of the proposed algorithm. Similarly no information is provided about the radio communication environment used in the simulation (Doppler spectrum, correlation between MIMO branches (if used) etc. ) and the traffic structure in the industrial wireless networks.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIEW 3\r\n\r\nIn this paper authors present a method to optimize the rate adaptation (RA) algorithm in 802.11 WLANs for industrial application. In particular, the SNR threshold and ACK/BACK information from receiver are used to increase the system performances.\r\n\r\nAuthor propose to use a commonly used method, the SNR threshold, with an algorithm presented in the paper [7]: this is not a strong novelty, but, because this is a WIP, can be acceptable. The main drawback of the paper is how is written and how it isn&#39;t clear. The proposed algorithm is understandable, but it&#39;s not clear how results have been obtained. Moreover, in Section 3 the equation (6) is not correctly described. Authors speak about the standard 802.11n, but all the tables refer to a 802.11g data rates set.

(1-3 sentences))\r\nThis paper proposes a RA (Rate Adaptation) algorithm for industrial WLAN. The authors combine two different existing RA algorithms to minimize the packet loss while the  basic procedure is based on one of them.\r\nStrengths (What are the most important reasons to accept this paper (e.g., technical depth, novelty, creative solution, importance of topic, etc.)?)\r\nThe proposed RA algorithm combines two different kinds of RA algorithms, one is loss based, and the other is SNR based. By doing so, it can decrease the packet loss.\r\nWeaknesses (What are the most important reasons NOT to accept this paper?)\r\nThe evaluation part is insufficient. The proposed RA algorithm is compared with only one RA algorithm which is mother algorithm of the proposed one. However, there are many different kinds if RA algorithms, so the performance of the proposed RA has to be compared with some other RA algorithms.\r\nComments to authors (Please provide detailed comments to the authors.)\r\nIn IEEE 802.11g overview, the sentence, “for every small decrease or increase BER of system performance, the modulation can be changing,” sounds strange. BER can change rapidly even though there is small change of SNR. Instead of ’BER’, ‘SNR’ seems more appropriate. \r\n\r\nIn Fig. 1, the title and y-axis might be wrong.\r\n\r\nThe 21th line if algorithm 1 has to be revised.

For example: EC, CT, TM, TPD, PM, AM, and so on. The proposed idea is simple and interesting. One issue to the reviewer is that the paper did not discuss the of network workload of the different nodes and the network bandwidth on the schedulability of the system. That is, in a typical real-time system, each task should have a formal specification of its workload, i.e. execuriton time, period, deadline requirements, and the system should have an available resource specification, e.g. maximum bandwidth. The proposed scheme targets the real-time switched Ethernet for naval combat system. The proposed idea shall guarantee the deadline requirements to be meet. This issues seems is not discussed in detail in this paper. The quality of the paper can be further improved if the real-time guarantee is considered further.\r\n\r\nHere are some other comments:\r\n1.      The proposed scheme relies on a spanning tree collection and a “hello” messages to provide high-speed convergence time. Why adopts spanning tree as the topology? It seems there are still many other topologies can be applied.\r\n2.      The illustrations of some equations are not clear. For example: in equation 10, how to derive the value of P(rM_i^n | CT).\r\n3.      In page 5, the proposed scheme set “Tree” consecutive times, then, the switch will decide that there is a connection problem between two switches. But, why use three? Why not 2 or 4?\r\n4.      It seems that the proposed idea did not provide QoS. As shown in the Table I, different traffics have different deadlines. Also, they don’t equal importance. We suggest authors consider the priorities of traffics to provide the QoS.\r\n5.      How to guarantee the traffics can meet deadline? If the network topology of the naval combat system is huge and traffic workloads are heavy, how to guarantee them.\r\n6.      For the recovery time analysis, we suggest authors shall illustrate them in more details.\r\n7.      Does the proposed scheme have backward compatibility? If yes, please illustrate them in more details.\r\n8.      In simulations, there are 9 switches in the topology. However, there are only 10-30 traffic sources. In a real world naval combat system, we believe the amount traffic sources must much bigger.\r\n9.      Authors shall redraw figures. All figures are not clear. For example, in the Figure 1, the words are too small.\r\n10.     It seems that the simulation results are only based on only one simulation. It would be better if authors simulate them with 10 or 100 times, and average them.\r\n11.     The proposed scheme only compare with the traditional TTEthernet. It would be better if authors compare it with some timely work.\r\n12.     Why the message deliver probability of the single message transmission mode is only 0.5 (while period>4ms)? It seems the message deliver probability is set too low.\r\n13.     What it is EC, TM, TPD, PMs, AMs? Please describe them in more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1.

Please make it clear to readers. \r\n2) Page 1:’ formation control of the network-based swarm robots is calculated by the front and rear robots and interrelation between them.’ That means the formation control of the robots is only related to the front robots and rear robots, and has nothing to do with robots on the left and right sides? \r\n3) Page 1:’the noise in the speed measurement, or uncertainty due to errors in the model can be included.’ How are they included in the model and controller design? The reviewer did not see the issues have been addressed in the work. \r\n4) On the spring-damper impedance model, for example Equation (1), the reviewer’s understanding is that the model should be P &#776;=-2&#12310;ζω&#12311;_0 P &#775;-ω_0^2 P based on the physical meaning as the damping force and spring force is opposite to the velocity and displacement? How is the model implemented in the terms of control strategies (it is PD controller or other specific controller?) ? \r\n5) More explanations should be given to Equations (2)-(4)? How are the equations derived? \r\n6) How is the spring-damper impedance control model integrated into the fuzzy control for obstacle avoidance? What is the connection between the parameters of fuzzy controller and the parameters in the motion equations of robots (spring-damper impedance)? They are separated or integrated in the controller design? (formation and obstacle avoidance) \r\n7) How are equations (5)-(11) integrated into the controller algorithm? \r\n8) Image system should be detailed a little more (hardware and software). The FOV of vision system can cover all the robots and how? What is the resolution and accuracy? \r\n9) In the Abstract: ‘simulation results show the advantages of the proposed scheme.’ It is ‘simulation results’ or ‘experimental results’? \r\nAgain, the reviewer hopes the above issues can be addressed with details so that readers can understand the work better.", "write_date": "2013-11-19T19:48:46Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.198", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 30, "fields": {"subject": "Yang Wei - ICTC2013 - A Self-stabilize Firefly Synchronization method for ISA100.11a network", "content": "======= Review 1 =======\r\n\r\n> *** Summary: Please provide a summary of the paper (the contents and contribution of the paper).

A typical shortest-path algorithm and a zigzag-path algorithm have been used. Novelty of the proposed work by the authors is unclear. In Section II (B), the authors must clearly highlight the differences and/or extension in the proposed work and that of [12], [13], [17], and [18]. Nevertheless, the authors use “shortest-distance” algorithm but have never mentioned specifically which algorithm has been used? A number of algorithms and schemes have been used in the proposed work without proper references of which part of scheme had been applied where and how? The authors must first highlight the problem focused and what has actually been proposed. The manuscript lacks clarity and focus.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\nComments to the Author\r\nReviewer&#39;s comments\r\n\r\nThe author proposes an insect behaviour routing algorithm for dense wireless networks\r\n\r\n1.      In the abstract the author states that this algorithm is used for “dense” networks. It needs to be clarified that whether the proposed algorithm is suitable for small number of nodes.\r\n2.      The mapping of “Bombyx mori” with the proposed algorithm is missing.\r\n3.      In section II B the authors have stated about “zigzag” path. Why there is a need to have a “zigzag” path? The geometry of zigzag path needs to be discussed.\r\n4.      In algorithm 1 the author have stated that “Perform any shortest path algorithm ”. There are various shortest path algorithm exists. Exactly which algorithm is used? Different types of shortest algorithms perform differently. If any specific algorithm is chosen, it needs to be justified.\r\n5.      The proposed algorithm must be explained with the help of an example.\r\n6.      It is required to exhaustively test the proposed algorithm. The author must compare the proposed algorithm with the existing one, which will prove the innovativeness of the algorithm\r\n7.      Fig. 6 and 7 are not cleared. The resolution of the fig. Must be improved.\r\n8.      Does the zigzag path used to obtain fig 6 is random or it is having any specific parameters? This needs to be specified.\r\n9.      The possible applications of the proposed algorithm need to be discussed.\r\n10.     Since the proposed algorithm is applied to wireless sensor networks, the effects energy consumption needs to be discussed. It must be compared with other algorithm. Because energy consumption is always an issue in WSN\r\n11.     In section IV B the author states that “However, in the modified DSR algorithm, the connectivity of each node is checked to find an alternate hop in order to make a zigzag-path”, the modifications to DSR protocol are not clear.\r\n12.     In the paper authors have discussed 2 protocols. But in abstract only one is reflected\r\n13.     As the algorithm is mainly applied for “dense” nodes, what is the point in discussing its performance for 2 nodes (Section IV B) If the algorithm can be used for small number of nodes then the abstract and title both should be revised\r\n14.     In section II D the authors have considered CSMA/CD protocol. Why?\r\n15.     In section III author says that “The DSR protocol is almost similar to AODV”, which is totally incorrect statement. If author still agree above statement it needs to be justified.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is found that the author&#39;s similar paper Similar paper “Male-Silkmoth Inspired Routing Algorithm for Dense Wireless Networks” had been already published at http://nsl.kumoh.ac.kr/include/sub.php?m=65&mode=Read&serial_no=201201060001&com_id=bi0001&menu_cd=30&class_cd=53&Page_Num=&left=&item=&find=&m=65 on 2012-06-01\r\n\r\nThe abstract of both the papers are almost same.

Should Pc not be the number of collisions divided by the total amount of packages sent. \r\n\r\nReviewer: 2 \r\nComments to the Author \r\nThis paper proposes two scheduling methods for shared time slots of the ISA100.11A standard. In traffic-aware message scheduling (TAMS), network devices are divided into groups and are allowed to access the channel in specific cycles. In contention window size adjustment (CSWA), the contention window is adjusted based on the probability of collisions. \r\n\r\nA significant limitation of the work is that it can only be applied to star topologies, while many industrial sensor networks are multi-hop mesh networks. \r\n\r\nThe research problem is not well defined. The paper needs to provide a self-contained overview on how the shared time slots are scheduled and how CSMA/CA is implemented in ISA100.11A. Sections II.C and II.D need to be reorganized. \r\n\r\nTechnical depth is lacking in the proposed approaches. TAMS simply divides network devices into different groups and let them access the network in different cycles. It is based on inappropriate assumptions. For example, the calculation of Pc in equation (2) is simplistic. Some important parameters such as backoff, contention window and delay time are ignored here. \r\n\r\nCSWA is not well presented and the intuition behind the protocol is unclear. \r\n\r\nSimulation settings are unrealistic. The simulation tool OPNET Modeler 16.0 is not well described. It is unrealistic to assume there is no communication error at all. Given the number of network devices as large as 200, it is not reasonable to assume all nodes can listen to each other’s transmission signal. The evaluation fails to show that the proposed approaches are effective in real-world networks. \r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3 \r\nComments to the Author \r\nThe paper describes two extensions to the ISA100.11a standard for \r\nscheduling sporadic messages. In case of collisions during such \r\ntransmissions when in CSMA mode, the authors propose either to adjust \r\nthe contention window or to group nodes in distinct clusters accessing \r\nthe channel at different times. The two schemes are designed to \r\nalleviate contention and hence reduce collisions, improving delivery \r\nand latency. The authors report simulation results comparing their \r\nmodifications to the behavior of the original ISA100.11a standard. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the paper falls very short in terms of novelty and \r\nmethodology, especially in the evaluation. Specific issues are: \r\n\r\n0) Why at all bothering with extending the ISA100.11a standard? The \r\nauthors seem to take for granted that some improvements are needed, \r\nbut never really tell the reader why. As far as a random reader \r\nknows, ISA100.11a may be just fine for the applications it \r\ntargets. A stronger initial motivation for the work is needed. \r\n\r\n1) The TAMS schema is largely a straightforward application of existing \r\nslot assignment algorithms. Besides, it is unclear how the \r\nmulti-channel operation of ISA100.11a would co-exist with such a \r\nschema, nor I understood how key parameters of the protocol are \r\nestimated at run-time, such as the number of contention slots \r\ninvolved in a collision (N_col). \r\n\r\n2) The CWSA method looks like a trivial adjustment of the contention \r\nwindow, already seen many times in the literature. More generally, \r\nI am skeptical as to how significant this may be even in the \r\ncontext of the authors&#39; work, given that at least based on the \r\ncurrent evaluation, the TAMS schema always outperforms \r\nCWSA. Therefore, what is the point of CWSA? \r\n\r\n3) A common issue of both solutions above appears to be the authors&#39; \r\nlack of knowledge and understanding of the state of the art. The \r\nauthors are invited to better consult existing works on MAC \r\nparameter adaptation and tuning for 802.15.4 networks, for example: \r\n\r\nMarco Zimmerling, Federico Ferrari, Luca Mottola, Thiemo Voigt, and \r\nLothar Thiele. 2012. pTunes: runtime parameter adaptation for \r\nlow-power MAC protocols.

The energy & latency issues of IWSNs are well motivated and significant, and a great deal of related work has been done previously. For the idea proposed by this paper, it is relatively new. However, its performance may be questionable, and some theoretical proof and more convincing experiments results are expected. As well, more explanations about the algorithms and simulation results should be given, because I don’t know what the authors want to express only from the algorithms or figures. In addition, the paper’s written and organization should be improved. For more detailed information, please check the following detailed comments:\r\n \r\n(1)     I recommend to use a notation table including all the symbols (e.g., T_R, d_c, d_t, etc.) in this article.\r\n(2)     The authors said they proposed their routing protocol based on SP100.11a. However, I do not observe much about SP100.11a in the system model and algorithms design phrases.\r\n(3)     What is the major contributions/advantages, compared with related works?

A performance evaluation of the proposed solution is conducted using Opnet. \r\nThe presentation of the paper is very poor and the results are not convincing at all. For example, Figures 8 to 11 show queuing felays as a function of incoming rates. Delays change in a way that does not seem to be linked to the rate (e.g. Fif. 9). Maybe I miss something but I don&#39;t see the reason for that. Maybe the simulations are not representative of what is going on. \r\nConcerning the proposed approach, presentation of existing schedulers is very unclear for someone who does not know them (I know them). The same occurs for the presentation of the new scheduler. \r\nI suggest that the authors fully rewrite these presentations. They should also conduct a deeper simulation study. \r\n\r\nReviewer: 2 \r\nComments to the Author \r\nThe paper presents a network scheduling algorithm for nodes that \r\ncommunicate over satellite links used for military purposes. The proposed algorithm, called Dynamic Weighted Deficit Round-Robin (DWDRR) builds on top of existing round-robin-based scheduling techniques and it is presented as a way to implement a simple, fair and priority-aware scheduling mechanism to multiplex network packets. DWDRR uses Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) to dynamically calculate the quantum for each node at each scheduling pass. The idea of expanding on existing RR techniques to keep the implementation of the scheduler simple while enforcing fairness and priority-awareness is interesting. Nonetheless, the paper has several \r\nweaknesses detailed below. \r\nFirst, the paper does not clearly state what is the problem that is being solved. It is easy to understand that satellite communication is a crucial component in military operations and that real-time network solutions are needed. However, what is not clear is why the problem of scheduling network flows on satellite links is different from scheduling real-time flows on different types of networks, such as wired and/or point-to-point wireless. \r\nSecond, the paper fails to review the consistent amount of related works about scheduling techniques for time-sensitive network flows (see works on UF-DRR and Proportional Fair). Moreover, the work about WFQ and PGPS that is mentioned to be in &#34;initial stages&#34; refers respectively to three works from 2002 to 2011, but: 1) Well established implementation techniques, simulation results and implementations on open-software routers exist for WFQ (see: Performance evaluation of the simplified WFQ to multiplex a huge number of queues, 2012; Implementation of WFQ in a distributed open software router, 2011; A Simulation Study of the WFQ Scheduler in a \r\nDiffServ Node under LRD Traffic, 2008); 2) none of the works [5] to [7] are directly connected to either WFQ or PGPS. In general, references in the paper seem to be randomly placed (see references [1] and [2]). \r\nNext, the section that should review the background and, in particular, the DRR and WDRR algorithms, are not well organized. As a result, having a good understanding of the mentioned algorithms is impossible from the paper itself. For example, Fig. 2 contains three steps of the DRR algorithm, but only the first step is (briefly) explained, so that it is impossible to understand the rule according to which Q is updated cycle after cycle. The explanation provided for WDRR is slightly better, but the meaning of last paragraph of II.C is still obscure. \r\nThe explanation of the proposed algorithm is also lacking. The high-level idea is simple and thus easy to understand, but the details of the work-flow are not included and the figures reporting the flowchart (Fig. 4), as well as the figure with a block-view of the scheduler (Fig. 5) are not even referenced in the text. Similarly, no mathematical analysis of the proposed algorithm is provided in the subsection called: &#34;mathematical analysis of the proposed algorithm&#34;: this section only contains some statements about how the exponentially moving average is used. Instead, this section should contain the mathematical framework that needs to be set in place to analyze the proposed algorithm. \r\n\r\nAt a high-level, DWDRR seems to have some desirable properties to be a good candidate scheduling algorithm for network flows. However, some major points need to be clarified and well supported: 1) if it is based on some estimation technique to update the value of Q, how can we guarantee that fairness is ensured? 2) what is the upper bound on the link utilization that can be achieved with DWDRR? 3) Why the nodes are not affected by starvation when DWDRR is used as a scheduling algorithm? \r\n\r\nThe carried evaluation has several problems. Once again, Fig. 6, 7, Table I and II are not referenced in the text. Moreover, the graphs in Fig. 8 to 11 seem to suggest that the proposed algorithm performs better - in terms of queuing delay - only on the lowest class of priority. The (poor) results obtained on priority classes 1-3 are not explained and, overall, it is not clear why, for classes 1-3, data are so noisy. It would be helpful to understand what is the sample size and number of runs, as well as what is the confidence/deviation of the results. All this is missing. The experiments about packet loss look a bit better. However, all the graphs seem to suggest that, even though DWDRR performs better, the improvement margin is still pretty low: less than 0.02% for class 1 flows; less than 0.5% for class 2 flows and so on. So, is it still a good approach given that the increase in queuing delay for class 1 can be higher than 20 ms with respect to DRR? \r\nFinally, there is a number of problems in the writing style. I am reporting some of them below, but overall the paper needs to go through a complete reviewing process. \r\n\r\nBad lexical selection: \r\n- &#34;The problem with the existing WDRR is spasticity [...]&#34;. Spasticity is a medical word and I am not sure how it can be referred to algorithms. \r\n- &#34;The quantum supposed to be assigned are [...]&#34;. The use of &#34;supposed&#34; is quite informal and does not fit well in a scientific work. \r\n\r\nOversimplification of concepts \r\n- &#34;if it is implemented in an overloaded environment [...], real-time performance can not be guaranteed. Thus, an algorithm that transmits data as quickly as possible is required&#34;. Real-time is not about transmitting data as fast as possible, but with a predictable timing behavior. Also, in network terminology, transmission time refers to the time needed to propagate a signal through the medium, not the time required by the scheduling algorithm to handle messages. \r\n- &#34;When RR assigns the quantum to each node, node 2 and node using a priority networks connection such as weighted round 3 are in the idle and overloaded states, respectivley. Therefore, it is an inefficient scheduling algorithm. However, if frequency and priority are considered in this algorithm, the transmission is more efficient and has a low wastage&#34;. This may be true, but need to be supported with either an example, extended explanation or with a reference to a (pertinent) related work. \r\n\r\nUnrealistic statements: \r\n\r\n- &#34;For example, if an enemy intercepts the information of our military forces, they can invade important military bases [...]. Conversely, we can deploy various strategies for an invasion&#34;. I assume that this paper is not being written in the context of an active war. \r\n- &#34;Further, the hard real-time requirements must be satisfied in an overloaded environment which changes from peace to war rapidly&#34;. No matter how fast diplomatic relationships can evolve, a change of scenario from peace to war does not happen very often and typically requires hours to days. So, the network infrastructure is not overloaded due to the frequent changes of status (peace to war), but maybe because the communications for military and civil purposes can share a subset of links. → 군 전용 위성이라는 가정이 없음\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3 \r\nComments to the Author \r\nThe paper presents a new network scheduler algorithm for military networks. The proposed algorithm, called “Dynamic Weighted Deficit Round Robin” (DWDRR), which is based on the Weighted Deficit Round Robin (WDRR) algorithm, adjusts dynamically the quantum size according to the instantaneous traffic characteristics. The system comprises an observer module that analyzes the traffic continuously and computes the adjustment to the quantum values. The estimation of the traffic characteristics is based on an Exponential Moving Average infinite impulse response filter. \r\nThe proposed scheduling algorithm was implemented in OPNET. The authors present simulation results for a military-inspired scenario. The evaluated performance indicators are queueing delay and packet loss ratio. \r\n\r\nThe base idea presented in the paper, which consists in adapting the quantum size of WDRR to the instantaneous traffic characteristics, is interesting.. However the paper has several serious flaws in terms of structure, readability, technical contents and validation. \r\n\r\nThe quality of the writing is extremely poor. There are several sentences that are completely unintelligible and many others require a lot of effort from the reader to make sense of. \r\n\r\nThe related work is also poor. The authors only present standard approaches like WRR, DRR and WDRR, omitting other closely related contributions (e.g. [1], below). The same criticism can be applied to the simulation results, since the proposed algorithm is compared only with DRR and WDRR. In addition, the descriptions of DRR and WDRR are not clear. For example, what the authors define as quantum is usually called the deficit counter, the actual quantum value is not explicitly stated, the graphical symbology used in figure 2 is not explained, etc. \r\n\r\nThe presentation of the DWDRR algorithm, in section III, has several flaws that make many aspects of the proposal unclear. The algorithm depicted in figure 4 is not explained in the text and has many parameters that are not defined (e.g. RAND_A, CNT, Qadd, ...). The estimation of the additional quantum value (section III.C) is also not clear at all. The text refers some parameters (B_{AV}, Q_F) that are not visible in equation 1 and it seems that a “1-\\alpha” term is missing in it. Furthermore, the output of equation 1 is not explicitly defined and it is not attributed to any variable. \r\nFinally, the paper does not present any sort of formal analysis of the proposed scheduling algorithm. \r\n\r\nThe evaluation of the proposal is also inadequate. To start with, the simulation parameters are not completely defined. For instance, the traffic patterns are not described (only bandwidth bounds) which is a severe flaw since the main purpose of the proposed algorithm is precisely to cope with traffic pattern variations. On the other hand, the authors refer in the text that the algorithm performance is strongly dependent on the values of parameters “TM” and “\\alpha”. However the paper does not mention which values have been used. Still in this topic, a sensitivity analysis of these parameters, essential to evaluate the practical usefulness of the algorithm, is not included in the paper. \r\nThe results themselves are not completely convincing. The relative performance of the algorithm is erratic, performing sometimes worse and others better than the other algorithms. Even when it performs better, it is only marginally. Therefore, in the reviewer&#39;s opinion, the relative performance of the proposed algorithm is far from proven. \r\n\r\nThe bibliographic references have several mistakes (e.g. missing authors [13], incorrect names (also [13]), incomplete identification of the event [5], ...), denoting lack of care in the preparation of the manuscript. \r\n\r\nBibliography: \r\n[1] Teck Meng Lim, Bu Sung Lee, Chai Kiat Yeo, Weighted deficit earliest departure first scheduling, Computer Communications, Volume 28, Issue 15, 15 September 2005, Pages 1711-1720, ISSN 0140-3664, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2004.12.015. \r\n\r\nAE Comments: \r\nAssociate Editor \r\nComments to the Author: \r\n(There are no comments.

Kim &#34;Interference-Aware Relay Assignment Scheme for Multi-Hop Industrial Wireless Networks&#34;, in submission, Ad-Hoc Networks, 2013&nbsp;\r\n\r\nReviewer #2: This paper presents a relay selection scheme that takes into account the channel state information and the packet buffer level. A probabilistic analysis is conducted towards collision probability.&nbsp; Network performances, in terms of packet delivery ratio, energy consumption and delay, are evaluated in OPNET simulator, which adds credits for the paper.The main problem with the paper is its lack of novelty, i.e., it presents a minor deviation from past works in the area of cooperative relay selection and protocols. It also lacks of implementation/simulation details.The best relay selection scheme proposed is a minor deviation from literature, such as reference [13], in the sense that the proposed scheme additively considers the buffer level.The paper claims one benefit of the proposed scheme is that if the destination successfully decodes the packet from the source, then there is no need for the relay to retransmit the packet. This seems quite obvious;many works on Hybrid ARQ (automatic retransmission request) have already tackled the problem by enabling relay only in case of decoding failure.The influence of relay interference is (very) insufficiently addressed in the paper, although the title of the paper clearly says &#34;interference-aware&#34;. Interference analysis is not presented, and even in the protocol level, the paper provides very vague arguments regarding a feasible implementation of the interference learning/management procedure, see page 17-18.The probabilistic analysis of collision is based on [13]. A simple M/G/1 queue model is also provided to consider the buffer level. However, the validity of the queue model is unknown, especially in a cooperative network context in the paper: (1) with source and relay, packet arrival may not be exponentially distributed. (2) in case of failure, packet does not actually depart the queue and MAC layer will retransmit the packet. A carefully characterization of the queue is needed.&nbsp;The simulation studies network performance showing the scalability. But it is very confusing that the paper says that the MAC protocol used is CSMA/CA for 802.11, because (1) relays have different contention timer (2) interference-aware scheme also necessitates modifications to the MAC layer. How to modify the timer, the network allocation vector (NAV) in MAC is not addressed. How to learn interference level through MAC operation in order to select relay is also not clearly addressed. These details are necessary to understand and validate the simulations presented.\r\n\r\nReviewer #3: This paper proposes an interference-limited relay assignment scheme for multi-hop wireless networks that exploits cooperative diversity to cope with problems of wireless channels and to enhance data transmission reliability.&nbsp; The paper seems to have good contribution, however, it needs the following\r\n1-compare the results with the very recent papers that deal with relay assignment.\r\n2-revise the introduction considering the recent papers.\r\n3- many parts are just repeated to each other, the paper is too long for such contribution.\r\n4- correct the spelling and grammatical errors.\r\n5- the reference list is not very recent.

Relaying is a spatial diversity technique which can achieve high energy-efficiency; hence it has become an attractive approach for lifetime extension in wireless networks. In this study, relay nodes are deployed either amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF) protocol between a source and a destination randomly. By estimating channel gain and residual energy of relay nodes, the source node can determine the best assistant relay to retransmit failure packets to the destination. As a result, relay nodes can keep the balance of energy dissipation and extending the network lifetime. Numerical evaluations show that the proposed scheme is fully effective in terms of the energy conservation for WSNs.\r\n\r\nRelated Reviewers&#39; comments\r\n\r\nReviewer A\r\n\r\n> *** Strong Aspects: Comments to the author: What are the strong aspects of the paper?\r\n\r\nThis paper proposes a relay selection scheme for relay networks where a source node communicates with a destination through a set of possible relays.

Results reveal that it outperforms other schemes in the literature.\r\n\r\n> *** Weak Aspects: Comments to the author: What are the weak aspects of the paper?\r\n\r\n Several weak aspects are identified:\r\n\r\n- The paper does not really fit very well under the scope of the special session, devoted to interference and design of future hetnets. The paper does not really deal with a heterogeneous scenario (i.e. involving multiple cell types, multiple technologies, etc.), but simply the communication through a relay. The paper does neither deal with interference aspects.\r\n\r\n- The paper takes paper [8] as a reference for their development, and in fact the system model in section II is very similar as in [8]. However, when looking at expression (5) (obtained from [8]), it is not clear the relationship with the received signal in expression (4), since apparently this expression is not really in line with the corresponding expression (2) in [8]. In particular, the paper assumes that the multiplication factor of hri,d·ysr,i is sqrt(Pi)/(1+Ps*|hsri|^2), while in [8] the multiplication factor is sqrt(Pi/(1+Ps*|hsri|^2)). Moreover, the units of (4) are not very clear, since the first term is a signal level (volts) divided by a power level (watts). To be physically consistent, the units should be volts. All these elements need to be clarified.\r\n\r\n- The proposed strategy assumes that the residual energy of each relay is known at the time of making the decisions. However, it is not explained how is this information obtained. \r\n\r\n- In Fig. 2, in order to know whether it has to be silent or to forward the packet, each relay needs to know gammas,d at the destination node. How is this value obtained? Is it the actual gammas,d or is it an estimation based on hs,d?\r\n\r\n- In eq. (3), hsri should be apparently hsd.\r\n\r\n- Given that [8] is a relevant reference for this paper, I would suggest adding the strategy in [8] as a reference for comparison in the results section.\r\n\r\n- English style needs to be improved throughout the whole paper.\r\n\r\n> *** Recommended Changes: Recommended changes.

In typical termites building hill strategy, after a termite walks through a path, it will leave pheromone, therefore the amount of pheromone of a path displays how much this path is used by termites.

It gives the impression that several aspects of the paper are unsound, because not mentioned or explained. \r\n\r\nSome examples: \r\n- context: the introduction contains several statements on CR technology, but a clear definition of a CRN and a clear problem statement are lacking. A SU will not use spectrum in use by PUs in order not to interfere. Clearly explain why overlapping transmissions are possible and can cause interference. \r\n- clearly explain the relation between the model and the algorithm \r\n- which knowledge is needed by the algorithm: is it centralised or distributed, do you need to know all the positions of PUs and SUs, etc \r\n- more detailed explanations: e.g. &#34;the algorithm allows selected routes that are corresponding to the fair costs for routing performance in CRNs&#34; => what does this mean? \r\n\r\nFurther, the paper is unbalanced. At lot of attention is given to the system model, whereas the algorithm is only briefly touched, although this is the main focal point of the paper. The notations used in Table 1 make the formulas not straightforward to read: X is used for position, subset of nodes, with one or two indices. \r\n\r\nFinally, some language errors need to be corrected. \r\n\r\n> *** Recommended Changes: Recommended changes.

The proposed interference-aware routing algorithm has been verified to be efficient and fair even under overlapping interferences. \r\n\r\n> *** Weak Aspects: Comments to the author: What are the weak aspects of the paper? \r\n\r\nWithin this manuscript, one of the core parts of the proposed interference-aware routing algorithm is the “so-called” PIA (percentage of interference approximation algorithm), for which only the feasible links with under 40% percentage of interference are considered. However, through the whole manuscript, there is no clear explanation on why and how the value 40% (percentage of interference) is chosen and determined. Is there any special reason on choosing this value 40%, why not 45% or 50% or even 60%? Based on different values of PIA, the routing performance might be totally different? \r\n\r\n> *** Recommended Changes: Recommended changes. Please indicate any changes that should be made to the paper if accepted. \r\n\r\nBased on my abovementioned comments, the authors are strongly suggested to explain the key reason for choosing and determining the suitable value of the percentage of interference and then carry out the relevant simulations by using the corresponding PIA values. \r\n\r\n> *** Relevance and Timeliness: Rate the importance and timeliness of the topic addressed in the paper within its area of research. \r\nGood.

Relay selection is an important tool to boost the performance of cooperative communications while avoiding the strict synchronization requirements of all-active relaying protocols. Therefore, the paper addresses a timely topic. However, the technical contribution of the paper does not reach a sufficiently high level to warrant publication in an IEEE journal. Relay selection has been extensively studied in the literature and, besides the four publications cited in the Introduction section, there are are many other works in this area. \r\n\r\nThe presented work here is incremental in nature and also includes many idealistic assumptions in the physical layer. For example, the calculation of Eq 2 requires the estimation of channel coefficient which is probably assumed to be perfect in simulations. Eqs (3)-(5) are also written under the assumption of perfect decoding at the relay which is obviously not always possible in realistic settings.

The method is compared with reconstruction methods employed in the field of compressive sampling.\r\n\r\nAs a general comment, for the reader it is hard to follow the rationale of the authors and to acquire a complete picture of the presented work as essential information seems to be missing from the paper.\r\n\r\n1. It is not clear for the reader what is actually being proposed as there are ambiguous indications given in the paper; more specifically, from the abstract and introduction it seems that Bezier curve based interpolation is proposed as an alternative to the reconstruction methods used in the field of compressive sampling, while in Section III one may understand that the Bezier curve method is an addition to some reconstruction method.\r\n\r\n2. It is not clear what the authors refer to exactly with the term &#34;Compressive Sampling&#34;. Usually this term refers to a large field in signal processing including different signal acquisition modalities and a large variety of signal reconstruction methods.\r\nThe authors should be more precise in this regard as they seem to refer to sparsity-based reconstruction, which is often used in - but not limited to - the field of compressive sampling.\r\n\r\n3. The authors should clearly state which &#34;Compressive Sampling&#34; method/algorithm they considered in the comparison with their proposed method. Without this information it is difficult (if not impossible) to assess the validity of the comparison of Section II.\r\n\r\n4. The description of the method given in Section I-B is not sufficient to reproduce the proposed method. It is not clearly stated what &#34;received data D&#34; refers to, what the &#34;key factor T&#34; is and how its being constructed. The same applies to the &#34;Equation Space Matrix&#34; and the &#34;Graph Space Matrix&#34;, whose exact indication of purpose and mathematical description are missing. Either references should be added or a complete description should be given.\r\n\r\n5.

Fig. 4(a): The original and the compressive sampling data seems to be missing from the plot.\r\n\r\n7. It&#39;s not clear to the reader on what grounds the comparison illustrated in Figure 5 was performed; In fact, the comparison seems to be unfair, as the proposed method uses 4 sampling points to reconstruct 5 data points, which implies a maximum compression rate of 0.8, while for the &#34;compressive sampling method&#34; a compression rate of 0.1 was considered.\r\nUnder these conditions the comparison in Figure 5 seems to be meaningless.\r\n\r\nAn interesting addition to the presented material could be an estimation of the computational complexity of the different algorithms considered.\r\nThese results could enrich the comparison and maybe reveal interesting design related trade-offs relevant for embedded system designers.\r\n\r\nOverall, the paper in its present form appears to be of little scientific value, mainly because the authors do not provide enough information that would allow the results and conclusions to be verified.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper presents a method to reconstruct data using a Bezier curve for compressive sampling. Although the paper addresses an interesting topic of data reconstruction from compressive sampling, the paper has various flaws which need to be addressed before publishing in a journal. Below are my detailed comments:\r\n\r\n1. The paper language and writing needs major improvement. Currently the paper has many grammatical errors that make it very difficult to understand this paper. Below are a few examples:\r\n(i) Page 1, line 36-37, first column, needs to be rewritten as: &#34;...where the sampling frequency is equal to twice the maximum frequency in the signal...&#34;\r\n(ii) Page 1, line 47, second column, the sentence should be &#34;A Bezier curve is a method which uses..&#34; instead of &#34;&#39;A Bezier curve is a method which is using...&#34;\r\n(iii) Page 1, line 50, second column, &#34;a Bezier curve can be defined&#34;, &#34;a&#34; should be in small letters as opposed to capital &#34;A&#34; currently in the paper.\r\n\r\n2. Introduction of the paper is not coherent. The first paragraph discusses distributed systems and then data reconstruction without mentioning data sampling or compressive sampling or the motivation for data reconstruction problem.\r\n\r\n3. Related work discussion is superficial.\r\n\r\n4. Bezier curve definition and illustration lacks clarity.\r\n\r\n5. The proposed approach in the paper also lacks theoretical substantiation.\r\n\r\n6. Page 2, line 42, first column, &#34;Starting from received data D&#34;, it is not clear whether this data D are samples or points, only stating data D is very vague.\r\n\r\n7. Organization of the paper is poor. Currently only three sections, Introduction, Results, and Conclusion. The proposed contribution is also mixed with Introduction.\r\n\r\n8. Define the acronyms in Table II, e.g., CS (compressive sampling) and BC (Bezier curve).\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper presents a method to improve the reconstruction of the data sampled and compressed using compressive sensing technique. The authors describe the algorithm used and provide an example to show the effectiveness of their work.\r\n\r\nThe paper contains some interesting and insightful ideas, nevertheless it has also several and severe weaknesses and cannot be accepted as is. I would suggest a new resubmission after a complete revision of the paper.  Here are the main comments and  weaknesses of the paper:\r\n\r\n- The use of Compressive sensing seems mainly an excuse to apply the Bezier curve interpolation. There is no reason why the propose approach cannot work also for a sub sampled signal, without compressing sensing.  The authors  should  explain better what is the role of compressive sampling techniques in this paper, otherwise it seems  that the contribution of the paper is just an implementation of a Bezier curve for interpolation.\r\n\r\n- The description of the algorithm is not clear and also some definition are missing or incomplete. For example:\r\na) What are Q1 and Q2 in Figure 2?\r\nb ) What is the role of Matrix T? How the value of the elements of this matrix have been chosen? Why?\r\nc) What are the role of Matrices ESM and GSM? Again, how did the authors select the value of the elements?\r\n\r\n\r\n- The simulation results the authors have presented are simply insufficient.\r\nFirst of all, presenting results over a sine wave is completely useless, both for the length of the sine wave and for the other signals.\r\n\r\n- The performance calculated on the images (Fig. 5) are insufficient to estimate the error of reconstruction.\r\nAn assessment about the accuracy of the reconstruction and the contribution of ICT in this role is fundamental , but cannot be extrapolated by only one experiment. It should be a statistic metric which results from an average between multiple tests.\r\n\r\n-Finally, what is the SNR of the reconstruction?", "write_date": "2014-03-17T11:40:55Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.6", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 46, "fields": {"subject": "Agi - International Journal of Electronics and Communications", "content": "Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider your work.\r\n\r\nProf. Dr.-Ing. Ralf Lehnert Editor-in-Chief International Journal of Electronics and Communications\r\n\r\nMs. Ref. No.:  AEUE-D-13-00584 Title: Decoding Scheme of Error Correction using Fake Error Addition: 4G Cellular System International Journal of Electronics and Communications\r\n\r\nI regret to inform you that the reviewers of your manuscript have advised against publication, and I must therefore reject it.\r\n\r\nFor your guidance, the reviewers&#39; comments are included below.\r\n\r\nReviewer #1:\r\n\r\nThe title of the paper is a bit misguiding, as it states that the paper relates to 4G cellular systems although only WiMAX is discussed. The authors mention this in the text, but the title would still need to be changed. Also, the main contribution of the paper is the retransmission scheme. This should be visible from the title.\r\n\r\nThe authors state that as long as the error rate in a given channel is far below the error correction capability of the LDPC code, the overall throughput efficiency can be improved if the proposed method is applied to the system. The reviewer finds this assumption to be rather strong, since the transmission parameters are generally optimized in networks to make the most of the available bandwidth, so the error rate in the channel should on average not be far below the error correction capability. The authors make no statements as to what happens if a retransmission fails. Additionally, based on the level of code trimming (3 - 7%) presented in the simulation results section, it seems that the receiver would potentially need to store quite many unrecovered codewords in a buffer for really being able to benefit from the proposed retransmission scheme. Intuitively, this seems to complicate the system quite notably. Although the proposed approach is fairly interesting, it is not discussed how it would impact on the receivers, i.e., hardware and memory requirements, increase in complexity, etc. The authors should discuss these topics in the paper and also potential risks with using the retransmission scheme. The authors should also discuss in more detail why and how the proposed approach is better than a regular retransmission.\r\n\r\nThe use of references could be improved. The authors state something and then list a number of references without commenting anything on those references. In general, a reader will want to know briefly how each reference strengthens the arguments in the paper. Additionally, almost all references are listed in the introduction, while there are places later in the paper which would need references.\r\n\r\nThe text in section 2.3 on page 4 is partially repeated on page 5. These parts should be modified in order to avoid repetition.\r\n\r\nFigure 1 does not notably help the reader in understanding the paper. A more thorough explanation of that figure would be useful. Figures 2 and 3 are quite complicated and should be explained in more detail. Furthermore, it is unclear what the E and M matrices in Figure 3 are, as they are not defined in the paper.\r\n\r\nFigure 5 needs more explanation. In Figure 12, it is not clear how the different trimmed codes can be seen in that figure.\r\n\r\nIn section 2.2 in definition 1, the variable H has not been defined. Unless the reader is familiar with LDPC codes, the reader will not know what H refers to. Lemmas 1 and 2 seem to be redundant, as they are not utilized in the paper. Additionally, not all variables used in those lemmas are defined in the paper.\r\nThe simulations are rather simplistic, as they seem to be made in a setting where LDPC decoding is done after transmission over an AWGN channel. In the reviewer&#39;s opinion, they should have been made in a WiMAX environment in order to analyze the true benefit of the method proposed. The simulations are also made only for a single code length and code rate, while it would be beneficial for the paper to present results for LDPC codes with different parameters. Furthermore, the results show a quite varying performance (specifically the 5% trimmed code in Figure 10) which should be more thoroughly analyzed. Maybe the variations would be smaller if longer simulations were run?\r\n\r\nThe results only show the number of decoding iterations required for successful decoding. What the paper really needs is results on how much the proposed method can improve the efficiency in the transmissions, since the authors claim that there is such an improvement. In the simulation results section, not all references to the figures in the text are correct (the authors refer to Figures 3 and 4, but these should probably be Figures 9 and 10). These need to be updated. The results are presented both in words and in the figures, i.e., what is seen in the figures is also written in the text.

This conclusion is based on several reasons. First and most no ticeable is the low level of English; while the paper is not unreadable, there are a large number of instances of incorrect gra mmar and style throughout the entire manuscript, which makes the text hard to comprehend (for instance, a good typical ex ample is the sentence &#34;In first, the impact of interference on the primary and secondary networks is investigated through the use of the cumulant of the aggregate interference as the interference model&#34; from the abstract, which has several English mi stakes).   \r\n\r\nMore importantly, the overall amount and depth of the contribution falls significantly short from the expected level of accepte d papers. I note that your paper consists of just a little bit over 19 pages (in single-column double-spaced format), compared to the maximum limit of 30 pages which is normally closely approached by most successful submissions and gives a good ind ication of the expected volume of the contribution. While we accept all kinds of contributions related to wireless networks - fr om purely theoretical to experimental implementations - every contribution must contain an original idea/concept of interest to the readership of the journal and be justified in detail.   \r\n\r\nIn the case of your manuscript, it is not clear what exactly the significant original contribution consists of, and the manuscrip t itself makes only a very brief explanation about what is novel in the proposed algorithm compared to existing ones. In my u nderstanding, the manuscript starts with a relatively lengthy discussion of the system model in sections II and III, which doe s not seem to be an original contribution but merely an exposition of some required already-known concepts (if my understa nding is incorrect, the paper would need to highlight this and be then structured completely differently, providing a focus on comparison with related work on interference modeling and analytically justifying the novelty of the proposed model). Then, section IV (&#34;Proposed algorithm&#34;) seems to present the key new algorithm of the paper, but it is very brief and uses vague a nd high-level language with almost no technical detail; even the detailed algorithm listing on page 13 uses extremely vague s entences (such as &#34;10.

The proposed algorithm is then not supported by any analytical or experimental contribution, and is only evaluated usin g a simulation study consisting essentially of a single scenario (with minor variations of the number of sources and mobility model), where the performance is compared only to a basic case and not to any other proposals in the extensive existing lite rature on routing in cognitive radio networks, some of which are in fact mentioned in the Introduction.

The idea is new, but the motivation is not clear, and its feasibility is in doubt. What is the advantage of mimicking male-silkmoth&#39;s flying pattern? It is not convincable that this routing protocol can save energy. Actually, it is shown in Figure 8 that this protocol consumes more energy than a shortest-path routing protocol. Then, what is the superiority of this routing algorithm when compared with the shortest-path routing protocol? In Figure 7, the zigzag path achieves higher throughput than shortest path, and the reason should be clarified.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation in this paper is not sufficient. It is significant to compare the male-silkmoth-inspired routing algorithm with classical routing protocols in wireless mesh networks or ad hoc networks, such as DSDV, DSR, AODV, et al. More routing metric also should be measured, e.g., throughput, routing setup time, packet loss rate, et al.\r\n\r\nDoes the male-silkmoth-inspired routing algorithm adapt to dynamics nature in wireless networks? Since wireless links are usually intermittent, how to maintain these information timely? How does the male-silkmoth-inspired routing algorithm locate physical positions of nodes to select a zigzag path?

The overall presentation and writing of the paper is not up to the mark. The reviewer asks the authors to look into the following  comments and improve the quality of the paper.\r\n\r\n1.The introduction section failed to clearly identify the motivation. Why should you chose male-silk-moth based routing that other generic routing protocols for WMN like Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol. Its is better to re-write the introduction so that the problem definition and contributions are clearly visible. Then, a separate related works section can be added.\r\n\r\n2.Why did you consider DSR as the base protocol for WMN. DSR is a reactive routing protocol which could be a good choice networks where nodes are mobile. But, in WMN, nodes are generally static and proactive protocols are likely choice.\r\n\r\n3.How the source node computed the total number of hops required for a specific destination?? In section II-B the authors said that “the number of hops for any destination can be used for assessing the total number of hops”. How can this be possible?\r\n\r\n4.Why always, after the traveling i/2 nodes, zigzag routing is introduced. What is the rationale behind this? I mean , if there are 10 hops, then up to five hops shortest path routing will be performed and after that, zigzag starts. So, my question is why after 5 hops, why not after 7 or 8 hops??\r\n\r\n5.In the simulation, a 100x100 wireless mesh network is considered, however, the authors stated that the topology is constructed on the basis of wireless sensor network!! So, does the node characteristics are of WMN or WSN?? Moreover, the authors need to consider that  in  a typical WMN, there should be one or more gateway nodes and majority of the traffic flows are  between a WMN node and the gateway.\r\n\r\n6.The reviewer does not think MATLAB is the best available  tool to simulate wireless network routing protocols. Rather the author should simulate using ns-2/3 or omnet or opnet to get a more accurate simulation results.\r\n\r\n7.Please consider the result shown in Fig. 7 which compared the throughput of shortest and zigzag path. Your proposed routing algorithm consists of both shortest path at the beginning and then, a zigzag pattern. So, why did you consider only shortest path and only zigzag path separately. Whereas in Fig 8. bio-inspired routing is considered along with zig-zag and shortest path.\r\n\r\n8.Need to consider other performance metrics like end-to-end delay, packet-loss-ratio etc.\r\n\r\n9.

By communicating radii information with adjacent nodes, a node can find its optimal zone radius. The authors claimed that the proposed algorithm achieve lower computational complexity, lower routing overhead and faster convergence than the original zone radius determination protocol.\r\n\r\nHowever, compared with the authors&#39; conference paper (see reference [10]), the contribution of this one is limited since the authors do not add much new content.

Load balancing is done by a threshold scheme.\r\nI cannot recooemdn acceptance of the paper for the following reasons:\r\n- The approach has an idelaized view on the world which probably does not hold in practice.\r\n  Usually the number of access points which can be reached is restricted due to channel\r\n  interference in particular if modern 802.11 protocol variants are used. Furthermore it\r\n  rarely happens that different APs with the same link quality can be accessed at the same\r\n  time. Interference or varying transmission conditions are not taken into account instead it\r\n  is assumed that all wireless links have the same quality. These conditions are unrealstic and\r\n  will not work in practice.\r\n- The simulation model uses exactly the mentioned unrealistic conditions such that the\r\n  experimental results are not helpful.

The algorithm is aimed at improving the overall throughput of the system.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the paper (motivation, problem formulation, algorithm description, simulation results) is OK, but the English is very poor and the paper results very hard to read. English errors and typos are spread on the text and make it quite difficult to understand its meaning. Moreover, the notation and scenario descriptions are sometimes too concise and, in general, quite confused.

First the authors say &#34;At any given time a wireless station can be associated with one AP&#34;, then they say &#34;Wireless station can associate one or more APs at the same time&#34;, what is the meaning of &#34;associated to an AP&#34;? Why is the association matrix &#34;fractional&#34;?\r\n\r\n- Is the wireless stations traffic supposed to be periodic? I am not very sure about the definition of &#34;load&#34;, the authors define it as a &#34;time&#34;, is it a fraction of the AP &#34;serving period&#34;?\r\n\r\n- The implementation description is not very clear. &#34;Who&#34; is supposed to carry out the different steps of the algorithm?\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------- REVIEW 4 ---------------------\r\nPAPER: 7\r\nTITLE: Dynamic Load Balancing Algorithm for Industrial Wireless Networks\r\nAUTHORS: Sardor Hojiev and Dong-Seong Kim\r\n\r\nOVERALL EVALUATION: -1 (weak reject)\r\nREVIEWER&#39;S CONFIDENCE: 3 (medium)\r\n\r\n----------- REVIEW -----------\r\nFirst: Please ask a native english speaking person to aid with proof-reading.

Running a periodic test on a simple measure for overload conditions, and then balancing the load, WILL improve for example throughput (which you look at).\r\nPlease consider other industrial networks.

The problem that the authors dealt with is scalability and stability of the simple discovery protocol (SDP) of DDS, since each time a new node appears or an existing node disappears, there is a need of numerous massage exchanges. Bloom filter is a well-known probabilistic hash table mapping technique. I can lead to uniform key distribution but with a big drawback that it does not support key deletions. This is why dynamic Bloom filter has been proposed by using dynamically several Bloom filters. This paper proposes the idea to use dynamic Bloom filter to reduce the number of message exchange of SDP of DDS. Experimentation using OpenDDS has been conducted. Performance in terms of the number of UDP packets and latency is measured and compared with the native SDP and SDP using Bloom filter. The results show that SDP using dynamic Bloom filter has similar number of UDP packet than SDP using simple Bloom filter; and it reduces the latency in case of one join and one leave node per second (1.0/1.0 churn rate). The idea seems nice. However the paper suffers from several drawbacks. It lacks a comparison with the authors’ previous work using modified counting Bloom filter [ETFA2013]. In table 1, it seems that MD5 is used. But it is necessary to explain what are the five different hash functions. Only one churn rate is measured (1.0/1.0). It will be interesting to add more churn rates to see the trend (e.g. 0.5/0.5, 2.0/2.0, but also 0.5/2.0) and fully evaluate the proposal. Some acronyms are not defined: GDS, DCPS.

Authors extend the node discovery protocol to support deletion under unstable network scenarios. The contribution of the paper must be highlighted. The difference with referenced related works, mainly [9] & [10] should be stressed. Authors should revise in depth the grammar and English style. There are many sentences that are non-sense and have grammatical errors. For instance, in the introduction section, paragraph 2 and 3. The referencing is quite strange. It is a mixture between Harvard referencing (by authors & year) and the numeric one. Please look at the template and follow the rules. It is recommendable to avoid the use of many TLAs (Three Letters Acronyms) but, if used, please define the acronym before its use.\r\n\r\n    C.

The paper is poorly written and not so clear. Nevertheless, the proposed solution seems very interesting.

The aim of this method is to provide a high quality reconstruction from undersampled image data. Processing a reduced amount of data has a direct impact on the transmission energy efficiency and transmission time.\r\n\r\nIn general, the novelty of the presented approach is very limited. The authors do not suggest any modifications to the standard Bezier Curve interpolation method. Furthermore, the title ‘Real-Time Image Transmission’ is a little bit misleading, because the focus of the article is on the reconstruction performance rather than enhancements in data transmission.\r\n\r\nThe writing style further limits the comprehensibility of the entire paper. Besides grammatical weaknesses, the meaning of some sentences, like e.g. ‘Bezier curve also used for smoothing hand-writing in electronic method to make smoother’ (Section II.C.), and paragraphs, e.g. the first paragraphs of sections II and III, remains unclear.\r\n\r\nRegarding the presented results, the evaluation lacks a thoroughly description of the test set. Does the sampling rate of 10 percent in the CS setting coincide with the amount of data used for the Bezier Curve interpolation? If the measurements for the CS based reconstruction are Fourier coefficients, what is the difference to DFT reconstruction? It seems to me, that the reconstructed images shown in Fig. 4b and 4c do not reflect the potential of sparse signal coding. Which algorithms were used here for comparison? I would suggest to first compare the proposed method with standard compression techniques like JPEG or with some simple interpolation methods. Then, one can evaluate the tradeoff between data rate, processing time and reconstruction quality. By the way, to assess the reconstruction quality given a ground truth image, quality metrics like PSNR or structural similarity might be easier to interpret for the reader.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, in my opinion this article does not have the potential for publication because of the lack of novelty and the deficiencies in the description of the evaluation.\r\n\r\n======= Review 3 =======\r\n\r\n> *** Technical Contribution: Rate the content based on its technical strength.\r\nAcceptable - Valid work but limited contribution (3)\r\n\r\n> *** Advancing Technologies / State-of-the-Art: Rate the novelty or contribution to military communications.\r\nLittle new here (2)\r\n\r\n> *** Relevance and Timeliness: Rate the relevance of the topic and the importance to military communication applications.\r\nRelevant (4)\r\n\r\n> *** Quality of Presentation: Rate the organization and readability of the paper.\r\nOrganization and/or writing could be improved (3)\r\n\r\n> *** Accept/Reject Recommendation: Do you feel that this paper should be accepted or rejected?\r\nAccept if room (3)\r\n\r\n> *** Comments to Authors:: Please provide comments to the authors that explain your numerical ranking:\r\n\r\nThis paper presents a technique to reconstruct images using Bezier curves.

The\r\npresentation is often unclear, and some concepts seems to\r\nbelong to a different paper (the references to the packet\r\nscheduling and size).\r\nThe results depicted in figures 3, 4 and 5 seems to suggest\r\nthat the proposed approach has almost the same performance\r\nof PTS. Indeed, the performance of the two algorithms should\r\nbe more clearly compared, and the authors should better\r\nexplain the comparative results. In other words, the\r\nsimulations fail to clarify the actual benefits of the\r\nproposed method.\r\n\r\nIn page 1, item 4 of the enumerated list, the authors say\r\nthat mutual exclusion is mediocre in non-preemptive systems.\r\nWhat do you mean as &#34;mediocre&#34; in this case? The statement\r\nseems misleading. A rewriting may help.\r\n\r\nFigure 1 reports a taxonomy of scheduling algorithms\r\nreferred to packet scheduling, not task scheduling. The\r\nfigure is useless: was it included by mistake?\r\n\r\nThe paragraph after Figure 2 is quite cryptic. It should be\r\nrewritten.\r\n\r\nIn (2,R), what is a &#34;sporadic speed&#34;?\r\n\r\nIn (3,L) the authors refer to the term &#34;packet size&#34;, which\r\nseems to be not correlated with the discussed topic.\r\n\r\nTypos\r\n\r\n(1,R) : inputoutput -> input/output\r\n(2,L) : devided -> divided\r\n\r\n\r\nC.

The paper compares EDF and PTS, \r\nbut it is not clear how the thresholds for PTS are \r\ndetermined.\r\n- Liu and Leyland do not consider dependent tasks, i.e. B_i \r\n= 0 in [12], hence [12] on p. 13 seems wrong.\r\n- [4] discusses limited pre-emptive EDF, the equation f_i^\r\n{(j)} = s_i^{(j)} + C_i only holds for non-pre-emptive \r\nexecution, however.\r\n- Why are tasks allowed to miss their deadlines (last \r\nparagraph on p. 3)?\r\n- How come EDF performs so bad (compared to PTS and the \r\nproposed method)? Does the experiment use limited pre-\r\nemptive EDF (from [4]) or the pre-emptive version?\r\n- How come the energy consumption DECREASES (rather than \r\nINCREASES) with increased utilization? This is counter-\r\nintuitive. Is that due to additional deadline misses?\r\n- Add at least a graph with the number of deadline misses \r\nfor each of the considered approaches.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.

The appraoch is shown to\r\nsignificantly improve over EDF in terms of number of\r\npreemptions and energy consumption, with performance\r\ncomparable to the preemption threshold scheduling scheme. \r\n\r\nI haven&#39;t been able to properly understand the presented\r\ntechnique, due to the paper being poorly written. In\r\nparticular, it is not clear to me how does the proposed\r\nscheduling scheme work and what are the design parameter to\r\nselect. It seems that the authors are trying to select the\r\noptimal lengths of the ON and OFF states, which may be\r\nmapped to a limited-preemptive scheduling scheme. But this\r\nis not clearly explained in the paper. \r\n\r\nIf the paper is to be accepted, I strongly suggest the\r\nauthors to clarify the contribution, model and design space\r\ndescription, properly explaining how the preemptions are\r\nreduced. \r\n\r\nIn the experimantal section, the authors may want to compare\r\nagainst a somewhat similar technique described in:\r\nBambagini et al. &#34;An Energy-Aware Algorithm Exploiting\r\nLimited Preemptive Scheduling under Fixed Priorities&#34;, SIES\r\n2013, Porto, Portugal, June 2013.", "write_date": "2014-08-07T14:22:07Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.13", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 58, "fields": {"subject": "Phuong - ATC2014", "content": "======= Review 1 ======= \r\n\r\n> *** Relevance and timeliness: Rate the importance and timeliness of the \r\ntopic addressed in the paper within its area of research. \r\nAcceptable (3) \r\n\r\n> *** Technical content and scientific rigour: Rate the technical content of \r\nthe paper (e.g.: completeness of the \r\nanalysis or simulation study, thoroughness of the treatise, accuracy of the \r\nmodels, etc.), its soundness and scientific rigour. \r\nValid work but limited contribution.

However, the concept of dynamic bloom filters has been reported in reference [17], the data distribution service itself is not a new issue, and the improvement of DBF in DDS over standard BF is insignificant to this reviewer even for the simplified case study. The contributiom seems insginificant to be accepted by T-II.\r\n\r\nThe paper is also subject to other issues such as the insufficent literature coverage and language issue. For example, what is &#39;GDS&#39; means on the first page? &#39;dyynamic&#39; should be corrected.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper proposes an extension of the node discovery scheme in data distribution service (DDS): SDP-Dynamic Bloom, to improve DDS scalability by reducing the number of sent and stored messages in the network.\r\n\r\nIn the Introduction, it needs more analysis about the related works. For instance, what node discovery scheme methods of DDS exist in the existing researches, what is the motivation of the proposed method ...\r\n\r\nFrom Section 2 to Section 4, it just introduces the DDS, SDP, and BF. Maybe it is better to reduce the proportion of these contents in the total paper.\r\n\r\nMoreover, what is the whole flow diagram of the proposed scheme in Section 5? What are the differences between the proposed scheme and the existing scheme?\r\n\r\nAs to Section 6, the simulation and the analysis are not sufficient, so that it is lack of convincing to support the outstanding conclusions. There are just the experiments under the 0.0/0.0 and 1.0/1.0 joins/leaves ratio. What about the results under the ratio from 0.0 to 1.0?\r\n\r\nThe English of this paper can be further improved.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nSeems like this paper has already been submitted, accepted and published at IEEE ETFA 2014 conference\r\n\r\nhttp://nsl.kumoh.ac.kr/include/sub.php?m=95&mode=Read&serial_no=201406050001&com_id=bi0001&\r\n\r\nSome very similar and relevant work already done by others have not been referenced or compared such as\r\n\r\n1) Journal of Internet Services and Applications July 2013, 4:16, A DDS-based middleware for scalable tracking, communication and collaboration of mobile nodes\r\nLincoln David, Rafael Vasconcelos, Lucas Alves, Rafael Andr&eacute;, Markus Endler\r\n\r\n2) Content-based Filtering Discovery Protocol (CFDP): Scalable and Ef&#64257;cient OMG DDS Discovery Protocol\r\nKyoungho An, Aniruddha Gokhale, and Douglas Schmidt\r\n\r\nThe progress done in this paper compared to their previous works such as in\r\n\r\nOMG Real-time & Embedded Systems Workshop 11th July, 2007 - Arlington, VA USA\r\n&#34;Scalable DDS Discovery Protocols Based on Bloom Filters&#34;\r\n\r\nis very insignificant and minimal and does not warrant publication in this journal\r\n\r\nAE Comments:\r\nAssociate Editor\r\nComments to the Author:\r\n(There are no comments.

In the case, the adopted approach is based on physical layer adaptation. More specifically, the transmitter receives information feedback from the receivers about the current communication state (RSSI and delay) then the proposed algorithm adjusts the modulation rate in order to improve the communication performance. It is important to say the proposed is addressed to IEEE 802.11 networks.\r\n\r\nThe multicast communication used in this paper starts with the transmitter sending an RTS frame, then the multicast receivers reply with synchronized CTSs. The CTS frames were modified to include information about the state of channel. So the transmitter sends its data and the receivers reply with synchronized ACKs. This is very interesting communication mechanism, but it is not a contribution of this paper.\r\n\r\nThus, the more interesting aspect of the proposal is strongly based on OFDMA with multicast ACK, that was proposed previously in references [18] and [19] and it was named as OMACK. It is important to note that the OMACK and the algorithm proposed here have very similar performances, as can see in results shown in Section IV.\r\n\r\nThe contributions of the paper are basically the mechanism of RSSI adaptation in transmitter (Algorithm 1) and the data retransmission mechanism (Algorithm 2). The work can be improved if the authors analyze others adaptation strategies and evaluate their performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\n*Summary\r\n\r\nThis paper proposes a novel rate adaptation algorithm for multicast communications targeting tactical networks. The work combines two different parameters (RSSI and delay) to select a proper data rate and employs an OMACK technique to improve the solution&#39;s reliability and timeliness. The rate adaptation algorithm is validated by means of a comparative simulation analysis. Although the addressed issue is an important research topic of wireless communications, the presented results do not show a significant step forward in the improvement of the state of the art.\r\n\r\n*Organization, language and written presentation:\r\n\r\nThe paper requires a significant language revision. Although it is written in a style that can be generally understood, it encompasses several repetitive sentences, typos and phrases with bad construction.\r\n\r\n*Comments\r\n\r\nThe paper lacks a proper characterization of the requirements of tactical/military networks. The text provides several hints about how stringent such requirements are regarding transmission delays and packet errors, but they are never defined. This fact impairs the analysis of the proposed solution&#39;s effectiveness because it is not possible to verify if the obtained results are good enough to support this type of networks.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that the TCP-Friendly Multicast Congestion Control (TFMCC) protocol exhibits a good performance. However, the developed solution performance was not compared to this protocol. This protocol should be included in the comparison or a more elaborated justification to leave it out must be provided.\r\n\r\nIn Equation 6, the data packet length is constant? It is not clear and has implications on the algorithm performance. If the packet length is variable so are the processing times in the transmitter and receiver (PT_Tx and PT_Rx). How was it implemented in the simulator?\r\n\r\nThe simulation scenario must be better characterized, preferably by means of a figure where the positions of the different stations are defined. In addition, a table containing the parameter values of interest used in the simulation must also be provided.\r\n\r\nFinally, when compared to the OMACK alternative, results show a small improvement. The causes supporting this fact should be further discussed together with possible improvements.\r\n\r\nSome typos (not all):\r\n{p. 2} &#8211; &#34;Such condition result in&#34; should be &#34;Such condition results in&#34;\r\n{p. 2} &#8211; &#34;MAC layer method use s frame/packet&#34; should be &#34; MAC layer method uses frame/packet&#34;\r\n{p. 2} &#8211; &#34;Other studies [9] have been presented RA algorithms&#34; should be &#34;Other studies [9] presented RA algorithms&#34;\r\n{p. 3} &#8211; &#34;and checks whether packet loss has occurred&#34; should be &#34; and checks whether a packet loss has occurred&#34;\r\n{p. 3} &#8211; &#34;method is that that the&#34; should be &#34;method is that the&#34;\r\n{p. 5} &#8211; &#34;to each sector, which resultings in transmission delay&#34; should be &#34; to each sector, which results  in transmission delay&#34;\r\n{p. 7} - &#34;The proposed method offers performance compared to the dynamic-rate OMACK scheme&#34; should be &#34;The proposed method offers an improved performance compared to the dynamic-rate OMACK scheme&#34;\r\n{p. 7} - &#34;if the retransmission of data fail,&#34; should be &#34; if the retransmission of data fails,&#34;\r\n\r\n(...)\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nIn this paper authors present a rate adaptation algorithm for directional multicast communication in tactical networks. In particular, the proposed solution is based on the received signal strength\r\nindicator (RSSI) and on delay constraints that are sent by receivers in the network. Some results, based on simulations, are presented to show how the proposed method can work.\r\n\r\nThe main drawback is this paper is completely out of the scope of the IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics. The title mentions “Tactical networks” and there is nothing related to industrial application or something that can be referred to.\r\n\r\nScope: IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics focuses on knowledge-based factory automation as a means to enhance industrial fabrication and manufacturing processes. This embraces a collection of techniques that use information analysis, manipulation, and distribution to achieve higher efficiency, effectiveness, reliability, and/or security within the industrial environment. The scope of the Transaction includes reporting, defining, providing a forum for discourse, and informing its readers about the latest developments in intelligent and computer control systems, robotics, factory communications and automation, flexible manufacturing, vision systems, and data acquisition and signal processing.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the paper is not clear: some sections don&#39;t describe well the proposed algorithms and, sometimes, strange parts are present without a reason (e.g. the weighting part in Section V). Also results are not sufficiently original compared to previous papers ([18][19]).\r\n\r\nAE Comments:\r\nAssociate Editor\r\nComments to the Author:\r\nThis paper proposes a rate adaptation algorithm to improve wireless communications in tactical networks. The domain of Industrial Communications is mainly related with the transmission of information for factory automation. However, if we consider a broad sense on the “Industrial” keyword, it is in my opinion acceptable to address applications where data is retrieved from physical elements and commands are transmitted to control a process or a system. Tactical networks are, as far as I understood, used in military applications. Can these be considered Industrial? May be yes. But then a clear overview of the application, of its requirements and how the “Industrial” label can be attached to it should have been provided, what did not happen. So, even not being so strict as reviewer 3, I consider, agreeing with reviewer 2, that all the motivation to do this work, the characteristics of the applications, the requirements and so are mandatory to accept such a paper.\r\nBesides this problem with the paper, reviewers have highlighted a significant amount of weaknesses that impair the paper publication such as the reduced incremental contribution from the OMACK work, the lack of comparison among techniques, the small difference in results, etc. I would reinforce these with some more situations:\r\na)      As there are no requirements, it is not possible to verify if the results are acceptable for the application.\r\nb)      Indeed, the authors speak about reliability but they do not discuss this parameter at all during the paper. Just as an example, one easily thinks about the question of how does the application cope with the failure of transmissions to part of the nodes?\r\nc)      The authors refer twice two methodologies to perform the rate adaptation: sequential and direct. They adopt direct. But they do not discuss nor validate the choice. No cost function or even qualitative arguments to assess/justify the validity of the choice are presented.\r\nd)      Section IV, which should be very important, shows several problems: a poor/light/incomplete description of the simulation scenario; a superficial evaluation of the results; a confusing text in the last paragraph.\r\nIn conclusion, looking at the three revisions and at my view of the paper I believe that the adequate proposal is “Reject & Resubmit”. Of course a possible resubmission implies that a clear justification of the interest of the subject to Industrial Informatics is provided.", "write_date": "2014-08-26T11:59:32Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.6", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 62, "fields": {"subject": "Noh Donghee - IEEE Communications letter", "content": "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nHere are review comments of my rejected paper from IEEE Communications letter.\r\nHope this will be helpful for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Author(s): \r\n\r\nThe review of the referenced manuscript, CL2014-1717, is now complete.

The proposed design is evaluated with a set of simulations. The reviewer cannot recommend the acceptance of the manuscript at its current stage, for the reasons listed below. \r\n\r\n(1) The main design makes some sense (e.g., the state machine in Fig. 1 and the Markov-chain based probability inference), however, its connection with the BCH code is not clear. In fact, it is not covered in the design. \r\n\r\n(2) The background (and related work) of this paper is not clear. The presentation is not reader-friendly - some equations are not well explained. Besides, the choice of some key parameters seems ad hoc. \r\n\r\n(3) There are some grammar errors and writing issues.

Maybe one should refer to [9], but the letter should be self-contained. \r\n\r\nThe algorithm for faulty node detection is not clear. Where is the BCH? What has been obtained from literature and what is novel? Some of these questions need answers. \r\n\r\nThe results are very poor and advantages with respect to the literature are questionable.

Summary of Review\r\n\r\nThe paper---an extended version of  a short communication published in\r\nIEEE Communications  Letters, 17:620-623, 2013---presents  a mechanism\r\nbased on the  combined use of CRC  and BCH codes to enable  nodes of a\r\ndistributed networked control  system to detect the failure  of one or\r\nmore of their peers. The failure  detector proposed is based on a very\r\nsimple ideia:  all nodes of  the distributed networked  control system\r\niteratively compute BCH codes from exactly  the same input, say D.  At\r\nthe initialization of the system,  a master node broadcasts the initial\r\nvalue of D  to all nodes.  Each  node computes a BCH code  for D, lets\r\ncall  it BCH(D),  and  sends  back to  the  master  a different  1-bit\r\nfragment  of  BCH(D).   The   master  collects  the  1-bit  fragments,\r\nreassembles BCH(D).   The error  detecting information  obtained after\r\nde-fragmentation and extra  information coming from the CRC  is used to\r\nimplement the  failure detection.  Failure  detection is based  on the\r\nstatistical characterization of the  patterns of errors collected from\r\nthe reassembled  BCH codes and CRC  codes. An important aspect  of the\r\nproposed solution  is that one of  the CRC bits is  substituted by the\r\n1-bit BCH  fragment. Substitution of  a CRC bit  by a BCH  bit implies\r\nthat the CRC code&#39;s ability  to detect errors is weakened.  Simulation\r\nhas been used to assess the  effectiveness of the failure detector and\r\nthe effect  of the 1-bit  BCH piggybacking onto  the CRC field  of the\r\nframe.  The  results presented are  very initial but seem  to indicate\r\nthat  the  proposed  failure  detection  mechanism  works.   The  main\r\ncontribution  of  the   paper  is  the  proposition   of  the  BCH-CRC\r\ncombination and its use to create an statiscaly characterized failure\r\ndetector able  to check  communication and  node failures  via pattern\r\nmatching.  The weaknesses of the paper  are (i) the master is a single\r\npoint of  failure, (ii)  the implementation  of the  solution requires\r\nchanges to the link layer protocol, (iii) related work is missing, and\r\n(iv)  the  rationale behind  the  analysis  of  the patterns  used  to\r\nclassify a node  as correct or failed require  better explanation, and\r\n(v) the writing must be thoroughly  revised. \r\n\r\n2. Detailed Analysis\r\n\r\nRelated work. Analysis of related work is missing.  The paper does not\r\ninclude a section on related work. This is a major problem as it makes\r\nvery difficult  to any reader  to localize the paper&#39;s  results within\r\nany of the research areas it touches. It its main contribution related\r\nwith failure detection or with error detection/correction in controller\r\narea  networks? Is  the result  more  relevant to  the researchers  in\r\ninstrumentation  and  measurement?   It  is the  assessment  of  this\r\nreferee that the  paper is very much tilted  towards low-level network\r\nand communications instead of parallel and distributed systems.  Thus,\r\na well-written related work section is a mandatory requirement for the\r\nimprovement of the paper.\r\n\r\nThe motivation  for the work is  very poorly argued as  the authors do\r\nnot  present any  typical reliability  data for  any of  the networked\r\nsystems mentioned  to support the need  for an extra level  of failure\r\ndetection.  The  assumptions  regarding  synchrony  of  processes  and\r\nnetwork channels also lack evidence. \r\n\r\nSections 2.1  and 2.2 can be  much summarized as their  content can be\r\nfound in almost any textbook on error control coding.\r\n\r\nWhat are  the possible  failures for  the environment  considered?  Do\r\nnodes experience permanent failures?  Transient failures? What are the\r\npossible timing faults?\r\n\r\nlines 156-158: BCH codes are generated as pseudo-code? \r\n\r\nline   164-165:   The  BCH   fragmentation-de-fragmentation   mechanism\r\ninterferes with the  CRC code computation at the link  layer.  Is this\r\nreally needed?  Could the mechanism  could have been implemented  at a\r\nhigher level? Why  haven&#39;t the authors made a case  for the link layer\r\npiggybacking of the 1-bit fragments?\r\n\r\nline 179: Can you define quantitatively &#34;sufficient sampling.&#34;?\r\n\r\nFigure 4: time unit? \r\n\r\nFigure 7:  The superposition of  the different patterns in  one figure\r\nmakes it difficult  to visualize and correlate  the different patterns\r\nto correct or faulty behavior. Axes lack units.\r\n\r\nSection  4.2   needs  a  major   rewriting  to  make   it  technically\r\nclearer.  What  are  the  time  intervals  considered?   What  is  the\r\nfrequency of sampling? Every frame received? Every two frames? \r\n\r\nline 379: Simulation environment and parameters need completion. What\r\nwas the simulation tool used to simulate the system? What was the load\r\nused to generate the frames and  to inject faults? How were the faults\r\ninjected in the frames (CRC, BCH)? How many simulations were executed?\r\nWhat was  the fault coverage of  the simulations both in  terms of the\r\nCRC and BCH accuracy? SNR isn&#39;t defined (signal to noise ratio). \r\n\r\nFigure 8:  The discussion of  the results  presented in Figure  8 need\r\nfurther clarification/discussion. It is not clear how the mis-detection\r\nrate is  related with the  fault judgement criteria  presented earlier\r\n(section 4).\r\n\r\nline 395:  &#34;In CRC  case, faulty  nodes are pointed  out based  on the\r\nerrors  are   mostly  occur  on   certain  node&#34;  Sentence   is  badly\r\nconstructed, rephrase.\r\n\r\nFigure 9  Characterization of  the results and  analysis is  poor. The\r\nnode whose  communication latencies vary  defines the base  SNR level?\r\nThis is not clear from the text.\r\n\r\nline  415:  &#34;This misdetection  behavior  can  be avoided  further  if\r\nanother filter is applied in the node detection scheme.&#34; \r\n\r\nSection 5.2 should include a  better analysis of the faulty behaviors\r\nwith better  discussion of  the pattern  matching and  judgement. Once\r\nagain, the details  of how the simulation has been  carried out should\r\nbe included.\r\n\r\n3. Organization and clarity\r\n\r\nThe  paper is  not  well  organized and  English  is  very poor.   The\r\ntechnical quality of the paper can  be much improved by: (i) inclusion\r\nof  related  work (ii)  creation  of  a  summary  of all  the  factors\r\n(components) that are used as input for the computation of the results\r\nused  to  assess the  correctness  or  faultiness  of a  node.   (iii)\r\nQuantification  of  the  time   intervals,  sampling  frequencies  and\r\nsynchronization  parameters  used  to  create  the  simulation.   (iv)\r\ndetailed description of  how the simulation has been  carried out: how\r\nwas the raw data generated? \r\n\r\nExamples of poorly written sentences are:\r\n\r\n&#34;The CRC code identifies data correctness RECEIVED by the RECEIVER by\r\ncalculating the message syndrome.&#34;  &#34;However, CRC calculation is based\r\non  the assumption  that the  node will  always calculate  the message\r\ncorrectly.&#34; This  sentence is  misleading, cyclic redundancy  codes do\r\nnot  assume anything  about possible  failures in  the circuitry  that\r\ncomputes  the   CRC.  Systems  implement  several   failure  detection\r\nmechanisms at different levels, so that  if a failure is not detect at\r\na  lower level  it can  be detected  at a  higher level.   &#34;This study\r\nconsiders the effects  of node reliability in a  distributed manner by\r\npredicting the  area in which  an error can frequently  occur.&#34;  Area?\r\nwhat is the precise meaning of AREA here?\r\n\r\nline 19:  CRC only guarantees  that the link  layer is able  to detect\r\nerrors not the whole system.\r\n\r\nline 25: predicting? The solution detects, it does not predict.\r\n\r\nline  35:  &#34;Regarding  real  time applications,  sporadic  data  react\r\nunexpected event.&#34; What are you trying to convey with this sentence?\r\n\r\nlines 69-70: &#34;However, the BCH code  as faulty nodes detector works in\r\nthe  sense of  parallel  frameworks.&#34;  What do  you  mean by  parallel\r\nframeworks?\r\nline 73: &#34;semi-parallel approach&#34;? What is a semi-parallel system?\r\n\r\nline 181-183: &#34;In this case, this paper suggest the data refinement is\r\nsupported by outside factor of BCH code.&#34;\r\n\r\nline  220: &#34;This  error interval  is the  main interest  of the  data\r\ninterpretation  of BCH  insertion code  result.&#34; Sentence  needs major\r\nrewriting.\r\n\r\nline 221: Therefore, one can easily assumed that if the error interval\r\nbecomes shorter  time by  time, the  suspected note  can be  judged as\r\npromising faulty nodes.&#34; Rewrite.\r\n\r\nline 291: patter -> pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #2: The paper proposes using a BCH code in addition to regular CRC codes inserted in the messages as a way to separate node failures from communication failures. According to the authors, using such codes would enable early detection of problems, including performance problems.\r\n\r\nThe contribution is not clear. There is no comparison to related work. It is also difficult to see why this approach is better then trivial approaches for detecting performance faults (e.g., watchdogs or even simple periodic heartbeats). If the paper assumes specific scenarios in fieldbus networks, this is not clear.\r\n\r\nThe paper needs considerable rewriting, for example:\r\n\r\n- Figure 1 should represent the key argument for motivating the paper, but it is not well explained and seems to add little information.\r\n\r\n- Figure 6 legend is &#34;Something about filtering process&#34;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #3: The paper addresses the problem of faulty node detection in distributed networked systems.\r\nThe detection is performed by inserting redundant informations (CRC and BCH code) in each message transmitted.\r\nAn algorithm is provided together with an experimental evaluation.\r\n\r\nI have the following issues with the paper:\r\n\r\n- The paper is hard to follow due to typos and unclear sentences. A proof-read is necessary.\r\n\r\n- There is no clear specification of the system design and the system model section is a bit obscure. I did not understand the following:\r\n    (i) which type of failures the authors are tackling, e.g. process crash? channel down? message loss? value faults?\r\n    (ii) synchrony assumption in the network e.g. synchronous system or asynchronous? Mostly synchronous? \r\n    (iii) network topology or system configuration e.g. are all the nodes connected? there is a well defined topology?\r\nLooking to Figure 2 I can assume that there should be some hierarchical structure but I do not understand if this is a logical structure or a physical one and if it is permanent or not.\r\n\r\n- Some crucial concept are not introduced before being used. Therefore, a reader, that is not completely confident with the subject, is not able to understand. As an example, the authors speak about CRC and BCH from the introduction without explaining that this are two coding techniques, they talk about CAN and Fieldbus without providing hints on the systems. This restricts a lot the set of readers that can understand the paper.\r\n\r\n- It is not clear to me which type of guarantees the solution is able to provide in terms of detection. Usually, when dealing with failures, Completeness and Accuracy of the detection should be specified. In other words, are you able to eventually detect any real failure? are you accurate in the detection? This is not clear.\r\n\r\n- The simulation environment is not clear making difficult to really understand the goodness of the results. In addition, some plots are not readable (Figure 11) or confusing (Figure 9).\r\n\r\n- A related work section is missing. This makes impossible to assess the contribution, novelty and originality of the work, especially considering that there exists a huge literature about failure detection in distributed systems.", "write_date": "2015-01-22T18:26:56Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.34", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 67, "fields": {"subject": "Long - VTC 2015", "content": "Relevance\r\n   3: Little relevance\r\nThe paper studies cooperative relaying in wireless networks that is indeed a relevant field of research.

The protocol operation proposes to use the location information of destination. The operation of the protocol is based on the assumption that &#34; 1) the opposite side with destination D is non-rebordercasting side and 2) the side with destination D is rebordercasting side&#34;. However, even if a &#34;side&#34; is geographically closer to destination, that does not guarantee that a route exists in that direction at every stage. \r\nThe operation of the protocol is not mathematically sound.

It&#39;s not clear to me what aspect in the concept has been advanced in this journal version. It is perfectly okay to make a journal version but the difference should be at least 30% or more. No clear explanation is available on this point; hence, I like to know where the improvements have been done and what are the differences with this paper?:\r\n\r\nTung Thanh Le, Do Duy Tan, and Dong-Sung Kim, &#34;Zone routing determination for IZRP based on bee-inspired algorithm&#34;, 2012 15th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION), 9-12 July 2012, pp. 750 - 756.\r\n\r\nOnly one statement is found, &#34;Compared to the previous work in [10], which has been demonstrated the effectiveness of computational time of the proposed algorithm, this extended paper shows the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in terms of convergence time2 since it is better than the IZRP algorithm.&#34;\r\n\r\nBut, this is not enough or more explanations are needed.\r\n\r\nMinor revision.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\n- In the whole manuscript, the term &#34;optimal&#34; is used carelessly. The proposed algorithm for radius determination is a meta-heuristic, so there is no guarantee that any optimal radius can be found. Moreover, the authors have not provided the mathematical formulation of the optimization problem for which they have proposed a meta-heuristic approach (ABC).\r\n\r\n- Description of the algorithms (1, 2, and 3) are very unclear. Inputs are not explained in detail. Notations are not defined properly, for example in Table 1, parameters with different indices are introduced while in their definition the index is not mentioned (what are i and j in L_ij ?).\r\n- In equation (2), k is not specified.\r\n- Parameter setting of the simulations are not given. For example, what is the impact of MCN on the algorithm performance?\r\n- In section II-B, it i stated that a &#34;protocol&#34; is convex function of zone radius. It should be protocol traffic.\r\n- Is the theoretical finding in section II-B (equations (4) and (5)) about the difference in computation time of the two methods supported by the simulations results in section III?\r\n- Figures 4 and 7 need legend to be understandable.\r\n- English of Section III needs improvement (e.g. &#34;the network performance is performed ...&#34;).\r\n- In section III-A, what is meant by the assumption that all nodes are connected? Are they all assumed to be in the direct transmission range of each other?\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nAuthors have proposed a Bee nature inspired algorithm for Zone Radius Determination in Independent Zone Routing Protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks.\r\nThe authors have claimed and demonstrated the results to be useful for further implementation of MANET.  The proposed algorithm is able to find out the optimal route from their hives to nectar sites but in the simulation.\r\nHow the proposed bee can be incorporated in any MANET route discovery protocol? What are the hardware parameters that authors should discuss in the paper?\r\nAlso, how the calibration is achieved on a real transport and routing protocol is not very much clear from the paper. Authors should also discuss real energy consumption or efficiency in the paper.\r\nThe quality of the English language still could be improved.

In the proposed scheme, each secondary user (SU) identifies a primary-user receiver (PR) with coexistence terminal or hidden terminal. If the PR is a coexistence terminal, the SU can continue his/her communication without vacating the wireless channel currently used. If the PR is determined as a hidden terminal, the SU vacates the channel and tries to find another wireless channel by spectrum handoff. In order to process the spectrum handoff, the authors also propose the efficient recovery spectrum handoff (ERSH) algorithm, which consists of a handshaking process, the construction of channel hopping sequence, and spectrum handoff channel allocation. The performance of the proposed scheme is investigated by Matlab-based simulation. \r\n\r\nThe idea of the PR classification is interesting and may be novel. However, the technical presentation of the paper does not meet the quality of a technical journal paper. The followings are some of problems of the paper. \r\n(1)\tIn Introduction section, the background of cognitive radio (CR) technologies are presented, however, these are well known aspects of CR technologies and not informative. The authors should describe the background of CR technologies as concisely as possible. \r\n(2)\tThere are many grammatical mistakes and typos. There are also several redundant expressions. The quality of English is not satisfied for a technical paper. \r\n(3)\tIn Section III, A. network model, the authors assume that a channel quality varies according to an ON-OFF process, where the ON/OFF period follows an exponential distribution. However, this assumption is not used in the following sections. Where is the ON-OFF channel model used? Simulation experiments? Channel estimation algorithm? \r\n(4)\tIn Section IV, mathematical presentations are problematic. \r\n-\tTime epochs t_1, t_2, and t_3 in equations (4) and (5) are not defined. \r\n-\tThe energy of the signal is defined in (4) and (5) with notations X_1 and X_2. In (6), however, E_1 and E_2 are newly introduced. Is X_i the same as E_i for i=1 and 2? \r\n-\tWhat are C_1 and C_2 in (7)? What is the definition of \\theta_i? \r\nAs a result, it is hard to understand what subsection A describes. \r\n(5)\tIn p. 5, left column, line numbers 44 and 47: \r\nLine numbers 20 and 21 of Algorithm 1 are referred to without mentioning Algorithm 1. \r\n(6)\tIn p. 5, left column, (3) BCI update, step 2: \r\nThe authors mentioned a random access protocol for broadcasting a list of spectrum handoff channel candidates. In general, the random access protocol for broadcasting causes a delay for packet transmission, degrading the throughput. Therefore, the authors should present the details of the random access protocol, discussing how the performance of the proposed scheme is affected by the random access protocol. \r\n(7)\tFig. 4 represents an example of ERSH algorithm, however, it is not clear what Fig. 4 shows. The explanation of 3) Spectrum handoff channel allocation is also unreadable. \r\n(8)\tIn handshaking procedure of the ERSH algorithm, an SU generates a beacon with random backoff time. This is also overhead of the proposed scheme, however, this overhead is not discussed in numerical examples section. \r\n(9)\tIn construction of the channel hopping sequence, the authors consider the channel hopping sequence, however, no summary is presented. Why the details of the channel hopping sequence are out of scope of the paper? \r\n(10)\tIn Section V, Simulation, how do the authors determine parameter values in Table I? \r\n(11)\tIn simulation experiments, the behavior of PUs is not explained. Because the performance of the proposed algorithm significantly depends on the PU activity, the authors should explain how PUs behave during simulation. Is ON-OFF process is used for PU activity? \r\n(12)\tFigure 5 shows all the four schemes, however, one of counterpart schemes is lacked in Figs. 6 to 8. \r\nFigure 6: no result for ProSpect. \r\nFigure 7: no result for Prospect. \r\nFigure 8: no result for Greedy channel selection. \r\nThe effectiveness of the proposed scheme claimed in conclusion cannot be confirmed due to the lack of results in the figures.", "write_date": "2015-04-02T15:37:54Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.196", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 73, "fields": {"subject": "Tien - INDIN15", "content": "C.

It also has several concepts that are not properly introduced, making the paper non-self-contained. This is particularly noticeable in section II.B.\r\nThe relevance of the contribution to the WFCS scope is also not clearly established.\r\nThere are some parts of the proposed method that are not properly justified on the text.

It is a closed work that includes simulation results. The paper seems a reduced version of a longer one with a too summarized presentation of most of the aspects which makes it hard to read and, in consequence, difficult to evaluate. \r\nThe previous considerations apply to all the paper. The paper doesn’t show the motivation to conceive the algorithm. The upgrade to the state of the art is not clear. The system model is not adequately defined and “the synchronous slot structure” (TDMA?) is not defined and as we imagine it, it seems too friendly for the applications. In section III, the spectrum sensing is not properly analyzed and is not very clearly described. Subsection B is also quite unclear and conditions such E1=E2 are quite unrealistic. A1 and A2 are first defined as integers and then as sets of channels! The “network is in state j” is also not explained. The algorithm description in subsection D is also not clear and some figures are left unexplained (maximum number of sensing actions = 5).\r\nFinally, I couldn’t understand how the authors sustain the statement in the abstract that the “proposed … algorithm significantly outstrips the existing … schemes” when no comparison is presented in the simulation results. Worse than that is that no intention is stated in the conclusions to do so in the future which would be understandable in a WIP paper. \r\nI also consider not adequate to state in the conclusion that “the … scheme can be easily implemented on existing devices …” without having discussed this point during the paper.", "write_date": "2015-04-13T10:06:55Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.196", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 75, "fields": {"subject": "Thu-wfcs2015", "content": "Review comments:\r\n\r\nReview 1:\r\nOverall evaluation:-2: (reject)\r\nReviewer&#39;s confidence:4: (high)\r\nThe paper focuses on the topic of routing protocols for MANETs.\r\nIn particular the author focuses on an algorithm LAZRP, a location--aided\r\nvariant of ZRP.\r\n\r\nThe paper contains some interesting hints.

In fact, the simulation parameters make a little sense in an industrial scenario, as well as the performance indices considered should have been much better detailed and contextualized in a typical industrial application.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, I think that the paper does not add any advancement to the knowledge in factory communication systems field.\r\n\r\n\r\nMinor comments:\r\n\r\n- labels on figures&#39; axes\r\n- measurement units\r\n- simulation parameters\r\n\r\nReview 2:\r\nOverall evaluation:-1: (weak reject)\r\nReviewer&#39;s confidence:4: (high)\r\nThis paper has a few issues that indicate that the authors have not yet done sufficient homework.\r\n\r\nWhen ZRP asks all peripheral nodes to disseminate a route request, it can be guaranteed (except for message losses) that the request will reach the destination and a path will be set up. However, if just a few peripheral nodes disseminate the route request, it is possible that the destination is unreachable through those nodes (the only path could be through one of the other peripheral nodes). This has not even been acknowledge. To detect this in simulations it is important to consider zones of no communication and longer paths.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect is that the results that are shown seem to be more influenced by network saturation, which affects equally both approaches, than the true difference among the approaches under normal network conditions.

The hybrid routing scheme intends to enhance network performances in terms of routing overhead and end-to-end delay.\r\n\r\nThis version of the manuscript could not be recommanded for publishing in the WINE due to the following comments.\r\n1. A number of researches had been investigated for mobile routing. For examples,\r\n(1) Cluster-based routing.\r\n(2) Hierarchical management for routing.\r\n(2) Geo-routing.\r\nThe authors are encouraged to refer above previous works in Introduction.\r\n2. It would be nice if the authors provide a good table that highlight previous schemes and provide the main characteristics of the proposed mechanism when compared to previous schemes. In addition, the contributions of the proposed scheme should be clearly highlighted.\r\n3. More experiments to show the performances compared with the related work are also expected. Specially, the evaluation should compare with ZRP[7], SBZRP[8], AODV [3], TZRP [9], Geo-routing or Hierarchical management for routing.\r\n4. The authors are encouraged to consider the scalability and mobility with higher speed in the algorithm designs for IARP and IERP, respectively, and the experiment designs are also required.\r\n5. The proposed scheme inherits the advantages of proactive and on-demand routing protocols. However, it will also inherit their disadvantages. The authors are expected  to explain clearly why the disadvantages of them can be reasonably reduced with cost-efficiency. This question makes the operations of the approach as well as the major contribution unclear.\r\n6. Authors should explain the major differences in the advantages of the strategy using Exps. (1) to (3) in the RREQ packet broadcasting to the k-hop strategy. I think they are similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #3: Author improve the presentation of the manuscript and in case of geographical routing protocols location is the one of the prime factor so try to consider it so that you can get more accurate results.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #4: This paper proposes the use of GPS coordinate for routing in MANET. It assumes all nodes have GPS coordinates readily available and then uses Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) but with a smaller set of peripheral nodes. It simply draws a line across the source node S perpendicular to the line connecting Source and Destination and only forwards the packet to the peripheral nodes towards the direction of the destination node S. \r\n\r\nIt reduces the number of routing messages, while increase the size of each message.\r\nIt shows a slight reduction in overhead.\r\n\r\nThe paper is well written and relatively easy to read. The survey of related work is comprehensive.\r\n\r\nHowever,\r\n\r\n0) The idea is simple extension of ZRP.\r\n\r\n1) Why use a straight line, if a narrower section of peripheral nodes a selected, then the overhead can be reduced even further.\r\n\r\n2) What is \\rho on page 3?\r\n\r\n3) What is the intuition of equations (1)-(3) describing the line? This is the most important part of the paper, but too little words are used to describe how the equation is derived.\r\n\r\n4) What does &#34;with condition of time stamp&#34; mean?\r\n\r\nThere are some grammar mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------", "write_date": "2015-06-01T11:49:59Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.114", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 77, "fields": {"subject": "ETFA-2015-WIP-heamin/jinyong", "content": "Reviews\r\nReview 4\r\nReview:\t%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n%% SUMMARY\r\n%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n\r\nThe paper proposes an scheduling algorithm, called the Dynamic Weighted\r\nDeficit Round Robin (DWDRR), for improving the QoS of communications\r\nbetween a military satellite and several military ground stations.\r\nSpecifically, authors propose to modify an algorithm, called the Weighted\r\nDeficit Round Robin (WDRR), which is currently used for this kind of\r\ncommunications. The already existing WDRR is a sort of cell scheduling\r\nmethod similar to the ones used in high speed switching networks (like\r\nATM), in which the quantum size assigned to each stream buffer is static.\r\nIn contrast, the main idea of the new DWDRR algorithm is to dinamically\r\nadapt, in each communication cycle, the size of the quantum assigned to\r\neach stream buffer taking into account the characteristics of the stream\r\ntraffic in previous cycles. In such a way, the new DWDRR algorithm can\r\nbetter adapt to changes in the traffic requirements of the above-mentioned\r\nmilitary satellite communications. The paper also presents some simulation\r\nresults obtanined using an OPNET model. Those results show that, when\r\ncompared to WDRR (and yet another algorithm called DDR), the proposed DWDRR\r\nalgorithm reduces the packet loss rate as the incoming traffic rate\r\nincreases. \r\n\r\n\r\n%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n%% PROS\r\n%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n\r\n- The paper is well motivated and the related work is fairly addressed.\r\n\r\n- The proposed algorithm is simple, yet technically sound.\r\n\r\n- The paper presents some preliminary simulation results that support the\r\nclaims made by the authors concerning the advantages of the proposed\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n%% CONS\r\n%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n\r\n- The writing of the paper in general needs to be improved.

Thus, it would be nice to see the same problem placed in a more conference-relevant scope.\r\n\r\nThere are many similar efforts in the community, in different scopes, that the authors should consider. Some very recent pointers, that may help in following other related works, are [1-3] below. In particular, note that the authors problem is similar to the optimization of partitions and their dynamic adaptation.\r\n\r\nOne aspect that seems strange is that the results are shown over incoming rates that are outside the defined requirements! Are the requirements wrong? Would the same results be achieved in the range of the stated requirements?\r\n\r\nAlso note that equation (1) is broken and it is not clear how the two parts should be joined. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, it seems a typical learning filter with a forgetting coefficient. In particular, T_M and alpha seem to influence the learning process in the same way. Thus why two parameters?\r\n\r\nThe English language is relatively poor and needs a major revision.\r\n\r\n[1] Quan Leng, Yi-Hung Wei, Song Han, Al Mok, Wenlong Zhang, and Masayoshi Tomizuka.

The main idea is to use the node location to reduce the routing protocol overheads, since only nodes towards the destination are “flooded” for the route request (RREQ). The authors have carried out a simulation study (using NS-2) to verify the improvements. \r\nThe paper is rather well written and easy to read. It’s link to the industrial communication aspect is unclear since it only focuses on the routing protocol evaluation (so networking oriented) and there are no issues on the QoS or real-time properties that industrial applications care about. The simulation results confirm the intuition on the improvement about the overhead reduction. What lacks is a deeper analysis of the obtained results. What is the impact of the node mobility? What is the impact of reducing the potential forwarders on the routing reliability (i.e. we can not find a path when restricted to the subset of potential forwarders, while it could exist other paths when all the potential forwarders are considered?)\r\nGeographic routing protocols have been extensively studied in wireless sensor domain. The authors should also include some more important results on the domain. For instance, how to deal with the geographic hole? How to make the protocol robust?\r\nReview 2\r\nReview:\tThe proposal is interesting as a WiP within the context of ZRP (Zonde Routing Protocol) and given the applicability to the coordination of mobile robots, it fits well the scope of the conference.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a few issues the authors should consider.\r\n\r\nDespite some benefits shown with simulation, the real benefit is not clear the benefit in practice. In particular, the paper misses a plot with the number of unsuccessful route requests in all cases. It is expected that the proposed method will fail more, particularly with less nodes and if obstacles are added to the environment. In fact, in industrial scenarios, the obstacles will be many and the relationship between geographical direction and routing will be lower.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, it may happen that the only available routes leave the source in a direction that is opposite to the source to destination geographical vector.\r\n\r\nA minor aspect is related to the plots that do not show important parameters, namely number of nodes when varying connections and number of connections when varying nodes.\r\n\r\nThe English language has frequent errors that hurt the readability.

CR and UWB are nicely introduced and their benefits for industrial networks are described and referenced. However, the combination of CR and UWB is not obvious (has it been done previously?) and the particular problems with spectrum sensing for CR in UWB is not described (I know that spectrum sensing for CR is difficult in frequency-hopping systems, so I expect it to be difficult also for UWB). None of the references seem to concern CUWBINs. Most importantly, the paper does not describe why the spectrum handoff needs to be improved (what is wrong with the current method? which methods exist today? when making the spectrum handoff more effective, what does that imply? shorter delay? lower complexity? using less energy?). In short, a text in the introduction that described what is new with your paper and why has it not been done previously, is lacking. However, when we come to Section IV Simulation results, we get some sort of indication as the results are compared to handoff with random sensing. This is good, but you need to mention handoff with random sensing and describe how it works already in the introduction, to complete the problem formulation.

The problem is relevant with the recent advent of underwater technologies and demand for civilian/commercial/military underwater applications. The authors propose a bandwidth-aware routing algorithm for spectrum-efficient and cognitive underwater sensor network that limits interference to primary users (including but not limited to marine animals) in the underwater environment. The analysis seems technically sound and the limited evaluation results, though could have been improved in presentation, support the argument. However, the reviewer is not clear on how this analysis is any different than tons of previous wireless network analysis work in general. The wireless networks are equally constrained in resources though the operating environment is more severe underwater. The paper ought to differentiate itself from such analysis when both optimization problems can map to a mixed-integer linear programming problem. Furthermore, it seems that the bandwidth-aware routing can be formulated as standard textbook resource allocation and routing problem and solved (approximation) via LP duality. The authors claim that &#34;no studies have been conducted on bandwidth-aware localized routing for UCASNs&#34;. It may be so for the UCASNs, but the problem seems to have a canonical map to an existing textbook problem. Just because the application is unique, does not make the solution unique. Therefore, the results depicted must be compared to some existing approaches to really show that it is unique and better than the current state-of-the-art solution to the generic problem even if that state-of-the-art approach was motivated using an application other than the UCASNs.

Selection is performed based on a dynamic SNR threshold and thus the proposed scheme suits dynamic networks. \r\n\r\nThe paper proposes an interesting algorithm, however in some moments the description lacks clarity. Below is a list of suggestions on how to further improve the paper.\r\n\r\nMAJOR COMMENTS\r\nIt is mentioned in the title that the proposed approach is targeting industrial environments, however no examples are given in the paper. It would be good to give some examples of industrial environments where the proposed scheme can be used. It is especially important since listening to source transmissions and forwarding packets needs additional energy. At the same time it is assumed that the helping nodes are moving and thus should be battery powered and should not have additional energy to perform relaying. Also, in the considered scenario the operating area is 30 km2 large and it would be interesting to know why area of this size was chosen. Moreover, it is mentioned that some of the nodes can be deliberately compromised but no examples of a situation where it can happen are given. \r\n\r\nThe second paragraph of introduction talks about relaying, helping and cooperative nodes, but the difference between these groups of nodes is not clear at that point. It would be easier for readers if the differences were explained, or, alternatively only one term was used when it does not play a crucial role for understanding. \r\n\r\nMoving to the related work part, it is not very clear what was done in the referenced papers and what is the difference with the current work. An additional explanation of the work done before, the things missing in the previous investigations and the parts covered in the current paper would improve the readers’ understanding of the current state in the area. \r\n\r\nIn Section IV, equation (5) assumes that positions of mobile nodes at the previous time epoch are known, however it is not explained why. ADV messages, carrying information about node positions are mentioned only in the end of page 3, after equation (5) is presented. Moreover, Rayleigh fading is mentioned in the text, but not in any of the formulas describing channel model. Additionally, equation (7) holds for AWGN channel with evenly distributed errors, but not for Rayleigh channel, where errors appear in bursts.\r\n\r\nNext, it would be good to add a little more details to Section IV.C. It would be helpful for readers if it was clarified how the equation (9) was built, the meanings of BERprop and BERcoop were explained. It is mentioned in the text that the equation is based on a model from [16], but a couple of sentences explaining the model would help the readers. Next, when the calculation of the average SNR is described, the primary relay node R1 is not mentioned. Is the comparison with SNR between the source and the relay R1 and R1 and the destination done at some point? It is important, since having some unfortunate positions of the assisting nodes it is possible that R1 is the best candidate to forward the packets. This discussion should be added, or if comparison is done, it should be highlighted in the text. \r\n\r\nNext, Section III seems to be too short and Fig. 1 representing time slots assigned to different nodes appears before Fig. 2, which explains the network model. It would be good to have Sections III, V and VI as one, showing the network model, superframe structure, describing the assisting nodes selection algorithm and the behavior of the nodes. Then, cooperative strategies of the nodes would be described together with the time slots assignment. Now, e.g. from the description given in the beginning of the Section V, it is not clear if the source node has 3 time slots for each packet or each source packet should be delivered in three time slots in total. Moreover, it is not clear how many time slots are given to the source and relay and assisting nodes. How the assisting nodes A1 and A2 and the relay node cooperate and decide who transmits? If e.g. both A1 and A2 fulfill all the requirements from Section VI, will only one or both of them transmit? And the relay node R1, does it always transmit or only if neither A1 nor A2 is able to relay the packet? And it is mentioned that assisting nodes might have packets in the queue, which packets are those? Do assisting nodes work as sources as well? Or they can be primary relay nodes for other source nodes? \r\n\r\nTalking about the superframe structure, ADV messages play a crucial role in the algorithm since based on their reception the SNR between the nodes is calculated, however time slots assigned to them are not shown in Fig. 1. Also, when are the ACKs transmitted? It is said in the text that all the assisting nodes send ACKs to the source, but in Fig. 1 as well as in e.g. WirelessHART, each time slot has time to send one ACK only, from e.g. the primary relay node. When do the other nodes have time to send ACKs? And how many listening and sending ACKs nodes are there in the systems? Do all the 100 nodes listen to source transmissions and try to cooperate? If so, than too many acknowledgments should be sent and too much energy is wasted on listening. And since different assisting nodes transmit in different superframes, superframe structure often changes. How do the assisting nodes know which time slot is assigned to them and who does the assignment? \r\n\r\nAlso, concurrent transmissions are mentioned in the text, but not explained. They should be described since it is usually preferred to use simple off-the-shelf devices for industrial applications and concurrent transmissions are not necessary possible. Are they supposed to be performed on different channels? Then it is important that possible assisting nodes listen to the correct channels at the correct time, or the number of possible helping nodes will be decreased. \r\n\r\nMoving to the results section, the choice of the operating area size and the parameters presented in Table 1 should be motivated. Which industrial communication systems require 30 km2 coverage? And it is said that two hops are used to transmit the data, but which communication standard can cover 30 km2 area with just two hops? Next, Table 1 says that CSMA/CA was used, while Section III describes the suggested dynamic TDMA. And it is not clear which scheme the proposed protocol is compared to. A conventional scheme is mentioned, but not described. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, the paper proposes an interesting approach to select assisting nodes in a dynamic network. However, the system model description is not clear. It would be good to rewrite the system model explaining the considered network, roles of the nodes, the superframe structure and maybe to show an example of how the system should work and how the nodes should cooperate. \r\n\r\nMINOR COMMENTS\r\nThere are some grammar mistakes, which should be fixed. For example:\r\n- page 1, left column, line 16: “… idle neighbors receives …” -> “… idle neighbors receive …”;\r\n- page 1, left column, line 22: “… eCoRSS defines a dynamic SNR … and decide which node qualifies …” -> “… eCoRSS defines a dynamic SNR … and decides which node qualifies …”;\r\n\r\nAlso, there are few difficult to understand sentences in the text, it would be better to rephrase them. For example:\r\n- page 1, left column, line 14: “However, …” -> e.g. “However, if a use has no packet in its queue, the time slot allocated to it can be wasted”;\r\n- page 1, right column, line 46: “In [10], …” -> e.g. “In [10], [11-13] the authors introduced several protocols improving …”.\r\n\r\nAnd, SNR between the source and the assisting node should be higher than the threshold, but in the text the opposite is sometimes said, e.g. on page 3 (line 6), page 5 (line 24) and in Algorithm 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nFor reviewer comments, please refer to the attached pdf.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe main contribution of this manuscript is to propose an cooperative relaying selection scheme , called eCoRSS, based on time division multiple access in industrial multi-hop wireless networks. It uses idle neighbors between a source node and a relay node to forward packets in order to improve performance of the proposed scheme. It analyzes selecting strategy and describes algorithms. Simulations show that eCoRSS scheme can improve the performance in terms of the throughout, end-to-end delay, and energy consumption. The document is easily to follow and the topic of the paper is interesting. However, I have some concerns as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) In the simulation section, the authors should compare the proposed scheme with some existed schemes. In Fig. 7, they did a comparison with the non-eCoRSS scheme. It needs to explain the non-eCoRSS scheme in detail. \r\n\r\n(2) In Fig. 10, the analysis results coincide exactly with that in simulation. What are the reasons? \r\n\r\n(3) What are the differences between industrial wireless network and general wireless network in the manuscript? \r\n\r\nOverall the paper presents an interesting study of a timely topic. The motivation is clear.

In particular, the paper considers only a very restricted scenario (see Figure 1), employs an approach that is well-known in the literature (using idle slots for cooperation), and provides only limited simulation results. This does not rise to the contribution level required for IEEE/ACM ToN.\r\n\r\n+ The paper is difficult to read, with problems with the precision right from the start in the System model:\r\n\r\n- the authors need to define &#34;mobility epoch&#34; carefully.

What does the author mean here by &#34;received signal&#34;. Is this a vector? If so, please show the indexing. I would think that y_{n_i} and x_s would need to be vectors, but h_{sn_i} is a scalar. But they all use the same notation.\r\n\r\n- if a_{sn_i} is the mean of the noise component n_{sn_i}, as stated after (3), then that means that h_{sn_i}(n\\tau) is always zero! I am sure this is not what the authors meant. But this is not simply a typo: I cannot figure out what they mean here. Something is wrong.\r\n\r\n- should the 4\\pi be outside the (.)^2 in the demoninator of (4)?\r\n\r\n- the restriction to BPSK is problematic\r\n\r\n- equation (7) only applies to uncoded systems, which are rarely used in practice", "write_date": "2015-11-09T09:56:16Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.161", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 86, "fields": {"subject": "Tuan - [JCN] Journal of Communications and Networks", "content": "Reviewer: 1\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe authors consider cooperative relaying in the context of underwater acoustic communications. It is demonstrated through simulations that it can provide improvements over non-cooperative relaying and shortest-path-first relaying in terms of average end-to-end packet delay, packet delivery ratio, and average energy consumption.\r\n\r\nThere are several considerations.\r\n\r\nSection III.C focuses on capacity limitation. However, the requirement R < C can be conveyed with one sentence or short paragraph. It would be better instead to devote a section on the transmission format. In the performance evaluation section, it is pointed out that the IEEE 802.11 protocol has been adopted. However, this paper focuses on an underwater setting, and readers may not be familiar with details regarding 802.11. In any event, it would improve the readability of the paper, and the subsequent discussion of the cooperative model, to include the most important descriptions regarding the physical layer (transmission scheme, modulation format) and MAC layer.\r\n(Should the link capacity check be relevant/important as it is considered in Algorithm 1, the authors could describe it in more detail in an appendix, taking care that the above considerations have an impact on the capacity. It also appears that the capacity is for a single link, rather than for the cooperative relay model, so the authors could perhaps be careful in describing the particular consideration.)\r\n\r\nThe last sentence of section IV.A states:\r\n&#34;Here the relay method relies on regenerative cooperation where the relay attempts to detect and recover the original message from the source before forwarding the decoded bits to the destination.&#34;\r\nCould the authors please clarify how the destination combines the bits from the source and the relay.\r\n\r\nThe last sentence of section IV.B.2 states:\r\n&#34;In addition, the stored SNR value corresponding to a neighbor is averaged between the SNR sensed from a CTS packet at the source and the average SNR estimated through overhearing of each neighbor.&#34;\r\nCould the authors please clarify which SNR&#39;s exactly are being averaged and the benefits of this process.\r\n\r\nCould the authors elaborate on the use of Ack-II. It appears the relay selection algorithms 1 and 2 select one relay node. What is the purpose then for other neighbors to first store the source packet in their buffers and subsequently to remove them? (Also would some neighbor nodes not overhear the transmission of Ack-I?)\r\n\r\nIn the first paragraph of section V.A it is stated that the simulation parameters can be found in related referenced papers. Is it possible to present the parameters in a table, or even an appendix if necessary, as that would make the paper self contained.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to clarify if interference was considered when simulating the routing protocols as that would be a significant performance impairment/limitation. If so, could it be described in more detail.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper investigates the use of a cooperative approach to deliver messages in an underwater acoustic sensor network. A multi-hop approach is considered where the best relay nodes are selected in a hop-by-hop way according to the network geometry and channel conditions. Additionally, the use of consecutive ACK packets is explored to reduce the transmission of duplicated packets.\r\n\r\nAlthough the idea of the authors appears to be clear, more details are needed to: 1) Better understand the scenario considered by the authors;  2) better understand the novelty of the proposed solution; 3) have a more clear and deeper understanding of the protocol performance and of the analysis conducted by the authors.\r\n\r\n1) When describing the protocol solution the authors always refer to the case of a path with a single relay node (i.e., a path composed of two links). Are the authors considering the case of multiple links and relay nodes from the source to the destination?\r\n\r\n2) Are the authors assuming a common destination node (sink) for all the transmissions in the network or the presence of multiple destination nodes is possible?\r\n\r\n3)The described solution makes use of: 1) An initial phase to determine the hop count from the destination to the other nodes in the network (HopToDest transmission); 2) a handshaking phase to select the best relay to use according to hop count, channel condition and ToA; 3) the use of acknowledgment techniques to notify about the correct delivery of data messages and reduce the transmission of duplicated packets. All these steps are really similar to what the CARP solution (mentioned by the authors in the related works section) does. It seems that the main difference is in the acknowledge strategy: hop-by-hop for CARP and end-to-end for the proposed solution.\r\nThe authors should highlight what is the novelty of their solution with respect to CARP and to similar protocols  already proposed in the literature. They should better describe why their design better fit the needs of an underwater acoustic network. A performance comparison  with CARP and any other relevant solution should be considered to show how effective the proposed design is.\r\n\r\n4) The underwater acoustic channel model assumed by the authors makes use of Urick and Thorp formulas. It is a  oversimplified  model (with respect to real-life scenarios) that does not consider the effect of link quality variations over time as well as the presence of asymmetric links. A more accurate model based on real-life traces or on ray-tracing software should be considered. One option could be the use of the Bellhop ray tracer with environmental data loaded from databases available online. This approach has been largely used in the recent past. Moreover,  there is the possibility to use one of the various open source frameworks (SUNSET, DESERT, etc.) exploring this approach.\r\n\r\n5) How is the source node computing the ToA for each node? Are the authors assuming a synchronized network or the round-trip delay is estimated for this? How are all the possible relay nodes avoiding to send the CTS close in time thus resulting in multiple collisions at the RTS sender? Are the authors assuming any desynchronization procedure?\r\n\r\n6) A TDMA approach is used to reserve the underwater medium but no investigation on the related guard times, TDMA time slot and time frame setting is performed. Several papers have been published in the past showing how TDMA can result in low network performance. Additionally, several papers have been published exploring the use of a TDMA approach with overlapping transmissions - thus taking advantage of the long propagation delay - to improve the throughput of the network. Have the authors considered these solutions or different MAC protocols when  evaluating the performance of the proposed approach? Can the obtained results be improved making use of a different and more sophisticated MAC?\r\n\r\n7) Since the time domain is divided in Transmission Durations (TDs) and one TD covers one round of control signal exchange and data frame transmission, how long has this duration to be? What is the delay suffered by the other sources in waiting their own slot to transmit? In which time duration are the ACK transmission taking place?\r\n\r\n\r\n8) The authors make use of an end-to-end approach to acknowledge the correct delivery of a data message. It is not clear however how these ACK packets are used and how long a source node will wait for the ACK before retransmitting the packet to a relay node (the same previously used or a new one) to then reach the intended destination. What is the overhead and delay introduced by this approach making use of consecutive ACK packets?\r\n\r\n9) The simulation result section is quite poor. A high dense network is considered while usually sparse nodes are typical for underwater network scenarios (tens of devices over areas of several kilometers). A time slot of 0.18 seconds is used but it is not clear how many data has to be transmitted in that time slot. The data packet size is set to 200B, what is the size for the RTS and CTS? What is the average number of relay nodes replying to request to send messages? What is the average length of the routes used to deliver the messages? How many source nodes are assumed? What is the traffic rate considered in the network? What is the additional overhead due to the protocol operations? How often is the hop count estimation updated?\r\n\r\n10) No performance comparison with similar solutions (e.g., CARP) is considered.\r\n\r\nOverall, this paper is not ready for publication. And not just because of the remark above. This work should start with better motivating and explaining why this particular way to exploit node cooperation is effective for underwater acoustic sensor networks. A better description of the proposed solution and of the novelty of the presented approach should be provided. A more accurate and deep analysis of the operation performed by the protocol and the investigation of a larger set of network scenarios should be conducted to better understand the solution results and performance. A more accurate model for the underwater acoustic channel should be considered presenting some of the dynamics typical of this kind of networks. A performance comparison considering solutions proposed for underwater acoustic networks should be investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe main concern about this submission is its rather limited novelty. The proposed scheme resembles the Channel-aware Routing Protocol (CARP), which is also briefly cited by the authors in the Related Works section. Arguably, the authors should be more forthcoming in the description of the similarities to the two schemes, highlighting the differences.

In the published paper, they investigate a 2-hops communication system that includes one source, one destination and k candidates for the relay. But, in the submitted paper, the source forwards packets through multi-hop (Large-Scale Wireless Networks) until reaching the destination differently from published paper. The authors should be refer their published paper to in this paper and explain how their previous work differs from this work. If not, rate-estimation parameter “A” will be a bit questionable.\r\n\r\nI wonder how the performance of this new cooperative relay selection scheme will be changed, if the channels are assumed to be fast fading instead of steady over time (quasi static). It must be done in the future. If they can do, the work will be more valuable. Nevertheless, I think the paper is enough to warrant publication. \r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper proposes rate-estimation based relay selection scheme (RERSS) for large-scale wireless networks (LSWNs) that effectively distributes traffic of packets from a source to a sink. \r\n\r\nComments:\r\n\r\nThe article is generally written well, however, there is scope for improvement in terms of language presentation is concerned\r\n\r\nFor e.g. consider revising the sentence for better readability\r\n\r\nDue to far distance and interference between nodes in a large-\r\nscale wireless network, direct data-transmission/reception between a source and a sink is difficult. \r\n\r\nLikewise, some portions of the manuscript requires rewriting for better clarity.\r\n\r\nIn the last sentence of para 3 in intro&#39; energy constraint is also a problem.Please include it.\r\n\r\nMay I encourage the authors to refer to the following published articles which are close to theory presented in para 4 with respect to CC?

Presented results show that relaying is more energy efficient than e.g. multi-hop transmissions. The paper presents interesting results, but a set of adjustments should be done before the paper can be accepted. In the introduction, when explaining the problem, it is stated that industrial devices are typically battery powered and that prolonging the period of operation, minimizing energy consumption and transmission power are among the most important factors in industrial systems. It would be good to add some additional explanations here and give examples of the industrial environments of interest as e.g. for wireless networks working on power plans reliability and timeliness are the main requirements. Also, introduction describes the problem and gives an overview of the related work, but it does not say what the current paper is about. It would be good to add one more paragraph summarizing the contributions of the paper and the derived conclusions.  \r\nIn the System Model section, the adopted channel model is described, however the reasons for choosing Nakagami distribution are not clear. No final conclusion has yet been made about one model describing industrial environments the best, but some references pointing at Nakagami model would help the reader. Also, a more detailed explanation of the considered performance measures is needed. All the indicators of interest are mentioned in different places in the paper, but the paper would be easier to read and understand if all of them, together with adopted assumptions, would be described in one place (e.g. the System Model section). Moreover, when energy consumption is studied, it is assumed that the nodes can adjust the transmission rate and power to reach the required quality of service and compensate for the additional time used (in case of schemes with the relay node). However industrial devices are typically simple and there is not much flexibility in the choice of the transmission rate and power. Furthermore, IEEE 802.15.4 is used as a base for several industrial standards, e.g. WirelessHART, and its typical transmit power is 1 mW, while the results in section V show optimal transmit power of much higher values.  In section IV.B it is not clear why energy spent on transmitting and receiving ACK / NACK packets is ignored. This should be explained in more details and a discussion on how this assumption affects the results should be added. The achieved comparison results are well presented with clear figures. However the supporting them text only describes the observations done from the graphs, but does not explain the trends. More detailed explanations of the reasons for different behavior of the evaluated schemes is needed for all the figures. For example, why outage probability for multi-hop scheme is better than for cooperative schemes? The relay node is located in the same place in both cases and in case of cooperative scheme the source has two chances to listen to the packet instead of only one chance in the case of multi-hop schemes. Also, in the beginning of the section it is stated that the results were achieved by performing Matlab simulations, but the figures look like they were drawn using the data from mathematical calculations (using expressions presented earlier in the paper). If simulations were performed as well, it would be interesting to see if simulated outage probabilities would match the calculations, although it probably would not be possible to simulate for the outage probabilities lower than 10^(-5). And finally, only three performance measures, i.e. energy consumption, transmit power and outage probability, are studied in the paper. It is stated in the conclusions that there can be other performance indicators on interest and some of them will be considered in the future work. However it would be good to add already into this paper a discussion section describing these other measures, possible trade-offs between them and how considering different performance indicators can affect the comparison and conclusions. For example, multi-top scheme would become much more energy efficient if time constrained is lightened, i.e. all schemes are given two time slots, and thus bit speed is not increased for the multi-hop and cooperative schemes. Also, only one position of the relay node was considered and it would be interesting to see how energy consumption of different schemes changes depending on the position of the relayer. It was mentioned in the introduction that the paper by Sadek et al. considered this issue, but a deeper discussion in the results section would make it more complete. \r\nThe reference list includes 6 citations of the papers with the same last author as in the current article. All these references are used only once and in a generic sentence. Thus, the list can be improved by leaving only one or two, the most relevant, references. \r\nAnd finally, it is stated that one of the main differences between the current paper and the reference [15] is that the current paper considers a channel with LOS and adds to the calculations a compensation for the extra time slot used by cooperating schemes. However since the conclusions achieved in both papers are quite similar, a deeper comparison between two papers (both, comparison of the setup and the results) would make the contribution of the current article stronger.\r\nThe paper is easy to read and understand, however it requires additional proof-reads. There are quite few grammatical errors, typos and unexplained things, e.g.:\r\n- abstract: this paper … and derives …\r\n- abstract: abbreviation IDF is not explained\r\n- section II: … this paper adopts an assumption that the network operates …\r\n- section III, just above (13): extra space before colon\r\n- section III, just above (13): … overall energy consumed to successfully … and to minimize …\r\n- section III, just above (13): … both Ptx and Prx are fixed and depend on …\r\n- section IV: selection combining is mentioned, but not explained\r\n- beginning of section IV.b: … the D node responds to the source node with …\r\n- conclusions: In summary this conclusion not only provides guidelines for relay selection algorithms, but also gives recommendations on when collaborative transmission scheme should be utilized\r\n- letter “S” is used both to refer to the source node and the number of transmissions in multi-hop and cooperative schemes\r\nAlso, it would be good to move Fig. 2 so that it appears on the same page with equations (9-12).\r\nReviewer 2:\r\nThe paper considers outage probability and energy consumption for well-known relaying schemes under Nakagami channel fading.There is hardly any novelty in the paper. The relaying schemes are well-known, and the analysis is straightforward. The introduction does not say what the paper is about, and the relevance for WFCS is questionable, as the topic is more appropriate for a communications conference.\r\nReviewer 3:\r\nThis paper analyzes the energy efficiency, outage probability and the optimal transmission power for Industrial Wireless sensor networks. Single hop, Multi-hop, Decode-and-forward and Incremental decode and-forward schemes are considered. A numerical simulation example is presented. Authors need to explain more how their findings differ from those of previous cited works as this is not clear enough in the introduction. Also a comment on the effect on parameters used in simulation on the distances at which observed phenomena occur will be useful. The statement &#34;the data rate must be greater S times than that of single-hop scheme&#34; in section III-B is also not clear.\r\nReviewer 4:\r\nIn this paper, the authors analyze and compare different transmission schemes for WSN in terms of energy consumption. Results show that IDF is the most energy efficient protocol.There is no new contributions in this paper, relative to the related work and particularly the two following papers where we find the same conclusions: Energy Efficiency Analysis and Power Allocation of Cooperative Communications in Wireless Sensor Networks (Wei Liu, Guangming Li, and Lin Zhu).Energy Efficiency in Cooperative Wireless Sensor Networks (Glauber Brante, Marcos Tomio Kakitani and Richard Demo Souza).", "write_date": "2016-03-06T01:33:17Z", "update_date": "2016-03-06T01:34:16Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 93, "fields": {"subject": "Load Balancing Mechanism for WLANs-WFCS 2016", "content": "Overall evaluation:\t-1: (weak reject)\r\nReviewer&#39;s confidence:\t5: (expert)\r\nDo you recommend this paper for TII?:\t2: (No)\r\nReview:\tIn this paper a load balancing mechanism for IEEE 802.11 WLANs is introduced. The mechanism is based on a throughput evaluation and the distribution of traffic to underloaded wireless cells. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, the paper is lacking a clear structure, and the style of writing and grammar must be improved, including the removal of several typos and the revision of several sentences (e.g. on p.2 -> &#34;... we assumed when some APs are overloaded then some of users associated with the AP should move other under loaded APs.&#34;). Please consider a thorough revision and maybe a proof reading by a native speaker. \r\n\r\nWithin the introduction, the main motivation for this work is not clearly highlighted and a problem statement is missing. Even though the related work subsection seems to be comprehensive, the discussed research is only briefly analyzed. Hence, it is very hard for the reader to assess the novelty of the presented approach. Please extend the state of the art analysis and consider a discussion at the end, which clearly highlights the existing research gaps in the area of load balancing in WLANs.\r\n\r\nIn Sect. II you are introducing the approach. The access point controller seems to be a crucial component of the whole system, but it is never been described. What are its core functionalities? It is really the case that a wireless backbone is used to interconnect the APs? This would probably introduce several challenges to be addressed. The explanation of the approach could be also improved. Currently, it is very hard to follow. A major question that came up during the review was how the nodes position is determined. This is a very important information to be considered when shifting a wireless station from one AP to another, because it must be in the coverage area of the new AP. Usually, the handover decision is taken by the wireless station, is there any communication established between the AP and the station to trigger the handover?\r\n\r\nFinally, the evaluation is insufficient in the reviewers opinion. The conditions and the relevant parameter of the simulation case study are partly missing, e.g. which channel model did you use? The used simulation model is not validated at all. Moreover, the obtained results are not discussed and the metrics are not clearly defined. Considering this, it is very hard to assess or to reproduce the presented results.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up, the idea of the paper is relevant, but its novelty remains unclear throughout the paper. Furthermore, the style of writing and grammar and the quality of the evaluation is not sufficient and must be definitely improved.\r\n\r\nOverall evaluation:\t2: (accept)\r\nReviewer&#39;s confidence:\t5: (expert)\r\nDo you recommend this paper for TII?:\t1: (Yes)\r\nReview:\tThe main aim of the authors is to provide efficient algorithm for solving the WLAN load balancing problem, focusing on distribute users amongst a set of APs in order to maximize the system throughput.\r\nTo this end, the authors introduce a novel load balancing scheme in order to reduce the load of congested APs by forcing the users located near the boundaries of congested cells to move to neighboring less congested cell. \r\n\r\nThe topic is important and interesting and the authors clearly show the goodness of their solution. In order to further improve the paper, I suggest the following comments for improvements:\r\n\r\n- insightful and practical implications of the proposed approach can be better explained into the paper.\r\n\r\n- the authors could improve the Related works subsection in order to show exactly what is novel about their study.

Girs et al, WFCS 2015). \r\nMoreover, it seems a squeezed version of a full paper. The theoretical part and results are squeezed into the paper and not sufficiently explained. Thus, this is not really a work-in-progress paper, where the discussion of the idea and related work is more important than results.\r\nThe authors do briefly refer to a few lines of future work at the very end but that does not really make this a work-in-progress paper. On the other hand, despite not referred by the authors, I believe the work is still in progress because it needs experimental validation in meaningful application scenarios.\r\nOther comments:\r\nThe motivation for low energy consumption in IWSN is not really well grounded. In industrial settings, large scale maintenance operations are always needed, at least once a year. This could include changing batteries in sensor nodes, but in many cases, batteries can be changed more frequently, if needed. The concern with extra low energy consumption better applies to large scale WSN deployed in inaccessible areas.\r\nThe authors seem to consider a doubled bit-rate with multi-hop to compensate for the total throughput. However, this is not realistic. In practice, multi-hop links will use the same bit rate and delays will in fact be longer.\r\nThere are many inconsistencies in the explanation of the formalism, which need to be improved, as referred below:\r\nEq 2 provides received signal strength, right? Please, say it explicitly.\r\nEq 3 is presented as a derivation of Eq 2 (the text says &#34;Therefore...&#34;) However, this is not evident.

Let make myself clear at this point.\r\nIn a cooperation network, you can choose to operate at the physical layer, at the MAC layer, or at the network layer.\r\nIn any case, you have to address the allocation process, i.e., how wyou allocate relays, helpers to the route or the source-destination pair.\r\nWhen you operate at the network layer, the optimization process benefit of the exchange of data packet among nodes but the optimization works at the long-term scale. When you operate at the physical layer, the optimization process might not be able to consider all the relevant network information but the optimization operates at a short-term scale.\r\nIn this paper, there is a mix of different approaches. The authors claim that they are adressing short-term variations of the SNR but actually implement long-term methods to adress the issue.\r\nSeveral points must be specified such as the allocation of assistant nodes to the route.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction \r\nThe authors present several references to justify the relevance of their proposal. First, I don&#39;t get how the proposal is related to the references. Moreover, the references are not presented in a coherent way. Indeed, cooperative communications were introduced at the level of a source-destination pair, using one or several relays in order to increases the spatial diversity of the source-destination link. Here, the authors&#39; concern is related to a path between a source node and a destination node. The path consists of a source node, a destination node, and several relays. The issues here are rather related to network and routing issues. This way to consider cooperative communications has been already considered in [1]. The point here is that the authors should be clear about the abstraction level they choose to tackle the issue. As soon as you consider a path and not a single source-destination pair, you address routing and network issues (network as the third layer of the OSI model) rahter than communication issues. The difference should be clearly pointed out. To summarize, the approach needs to be further justified and the authors should motivate the model they focus on.\r\nMoreover, many papers have already address the relay selection issue without explicitly mentionning the mobility of the nodes. The fact that the mobility should be addressed should also be motivated. The seminal work in [2], or other works like [3] already addressed the relay selection issue. My point here is that the model needs to be further motivated.\r\n\r\nSystem model\r\nDo the author have an idea of a realistic scenario presented in the first sentences of the &#34;System Model&#34; section ?\r\nThe notation with an asterisk is awkward since it often denote the complex conjugate. We know form the alphabet of emitted symbol that we deal with a BPSK. Please introduce the modulation here. The authors should provide a short explanation of (5). What is the point in considering 57) as a performance indicator rather than (6) ?\r\nI feel a little bit confused with the lable of the node. Indeed, since the early works on cooperative communications in 2003, the &#34;assistant nodes&#34; are refered to as &#34;relay nodes&#34;. In this paper, relays nodes are just nodes on a path between a source and a destination. \r\nThe third condition in 2.2 needs further motivation. Moreover, even if the paper presents a method to select assistant nodes, there is a missing step here, in my opinion: assistant nodes should be allocated to the route. I mean assistant node should be aware, somehow, that they must help the forwarding of packets from the source to the sink.\r\nThe TDMA approach has been already used in approaches in [4]. Moreover, the amount of time dedicated to the selection process seems to be time consuming (100 slots !).\r\nMoreover, BER is not the suitable indicator in this context because it depends on the modulation type. All the seminal works on cooperative communucations rather use a more general parameter: the outage probability.\r\nThe integration of a MRC receiver implies a way to synchronize emitters. This issue is not addressed but is of paramount interest.\r\n\r\nCooperative strategy in a MWN\r\nAgain, the allocation of A1 and A2 to the process should be adressed.\r\nI don&#39;t get why the source node should transmit its packet during three time-slots since the advantage of having overhearing terminals is that we don&#39;t have to transmit the packet several times but once for all. I don&#39;t get why relaying nodes A1 and A2 should transmit an ACK to S since they are supposed to be in the range of S. Since they are in the range of S, they should be able to decode successfully the packets from S. Moreover, lot of overhead is needed here and that counterbalances drastically the avdantage of spatial diversity considered in cooperative networks. \r\n\r\nECoRSS\r\nAs we go deeper in the explanation of the protocol, other issues appear in the rationale of the approach. Indeed, the protocol depends on ADV packets. However, we know that the network conditions will vary a lot between the receiving of two ADV packets, and the point of the authors is to adapt dynamically to the network conditions. The ADV-based adaptation is a long-term adaptation whereas the authors refer to short-terms variations of the SNR. This is a contradiction here, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n[1] P. Liu, Z. Tao, S.

Roughly speaking, the proposed trimming scheme removes some coded bits from a codeword so as to reduce the number of required transmission. If the channel quality is in good conditions, i.e., less error will occur during those transmissions, then the removed parts are likely to be recovered by the powerful error-correction capability of the code. Some of my personal concerns are listed below.\r\n\r\n1. Since the correlation between the trimmed parity bits and the systematic parts are not considered, it is not clear to me why the trimmed parity bits are required to be distributed and replace the systematic bits. We may consider the following scheme to emphasize this point. Suppose that the post-processing of an LDPC encoder only removes some systematic bits of a codeword and we transmit the partial codeword. At the receiver, a uniform binary random number generator is used to guess the removed systematic bits. If the information bits are uniformly distributed, then each of the guesses will be correct with fifty percent chance. Afterwards, the decoder is enabled to decode such received codeword. To me, it seems no difference between the proposed scheme and this scheme. And in fact, such a random guess strategy has been applied to help the decoding of punctured codes; their main idea is also to reduce the retransmission by exploiting the powerful correction capability of channel codes.\r\n\r\n2. I agree with that sometimes the data protection is provided more than the needs. In this case, bandwidth efficiency is not so well. Therefore, puncturing is usually adapted to alleviate this situation. Puncturing is commonly used in convolutional codes because it can simplify the procedure of finding good puncturing patterns.  In the proposed scheme, the locations of the replaced systematic bits are also required to be optimized. For block codes, I think that it is not an easy job, and this paper does not discuss much on this part, too. It will be much interesting if some criteria or observation to determine the locations of replacing are provided.\r\n\r\nMany typos and imprecise operations are found in this manuscript. For example,\r\na. Line 10 of paragraph 2, page 2, “ar the same time” should be “at …”\r\nb. Some subscripts in Lemma 1 are not in correct form.\r\nc. Line 2 in Lemma 2, “hwere” should be “where”\r\nd. Line 5 in page 6, “…parity note being damaged” should be “… not being …”\r\ne. Line 1 of paragraph 5, page 7, “The transmitter than get” should be “… then get…”\r\nf. In Lemma 1, the authors write P_{rec}=(\\bar{c}, r, \\bm{H})-P_{err}(C)=n>0, where $n$ is number of errors while P_{rec} is the maximum recovery probability. How can the two quantities be compared?\r\ng. In (1), the minus and plus operations are not well-defined. Are they corresponding to removing and appending of strings, respectively?\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper proposed a novel scheme to reduce retransmission latency by using a trimming code on LDPC. It would be better if the authors work on how to choose parity-checks and messages to improve the performance. Moreover, there are no examples to concretely illustrate how many time can the proposed method reduce the retransmission communicate. Last, a comparison with the method proposed in [6] may help to further investigate the ability of the proposed method to reduce retransmission latency.\r\n\r\nHere are my detailed comments:\r\n1)      Please briefly discuss the novelty of this paper compared with [6] and add some simulations to show the retransmission latency of the proposed method under different trimmed code conditions.\r\n\r\n2)      As shown in Fig.7, the 5% trimmed code requires the almost least iterations compared with the other trimmed codes when the SNR level is larger than 7. However, when SNR level is smaller than 7, the 5% trimmed code requires the largest iterations compared with the other trimmed codes. Hence, it might be worth explaining the reason of the surge in the iterations of the 5% trimmed code.\r\n\r\n3)      On page 9 ” The code reaches the limit of its ability for the 7% trimmed code condition. This is because when the SNR level is 6, the code cannot be corrected”. However, it does not show the iteration number of the 7% trimmed code at the SNR level of 6 in Fig.7. Please complete the curve of the 7% trimmed code and add the curve of the 10% trimmed code which is also mentioned in this paper.\r\n\r\n4)      There are some minor mistakes in writing, for example:\r\n&#34;hwere&#34; in Line 2 of the Lemma 2 of Page 3 should be &#34;where”\r\nIn Line 8, Page 5, there are two “.”s.\r\n&#34;ar&#34; in Line 7, Page 5 should be &#34;at”\r\n“Figure 8” in Line 10, Page 7 should be &#34; Figure 5”\r\n\r\n5) It would be better if the authors add more advanced techniques,  recent algebraic construction, decoding based on majority logic and low-complexity encoding based Galois FFT, in their description of LDPC codes to show that QC-LDPC codes are suitable for such retransmission scheme.", "write_date": "2016-04-25T13:56:53Z", "update_date": "2017-04-19T11:42:46Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 98, "fields": {"subject": "Tuan - IET Wireless Sensor Systems", "content": "Dear Prof. Kim \r\n\r\nWSS-2016-0036 \r\n\r\nExploiting Cooperative Relay for Reliable Communications in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks \r\n\r\nThank you for submitting your paper to IET Wireless Sensor Systems.

Several of the assumptions are not realistic for industrial communication:\r\n\r\nThe assumption of one single factory wireless network consisting of 200 randomly placed nodes is not realistic. For a factory system, the number of wireless nodes in one single network would be much much lower, making the need for clustering not necessary. If 200 wireless nodes really would be required in total in a factory, they would be in many separate networks, each of much smaller size.\r\n\r\nThe assumption of 200 wireless nodes all being within carrier sense range of each other, yet requiring advanced relaying, is not realistic in a factory setting: in a real factory setting either a star topology would be sufficient because of small distances and few nodes, or if multi-hop is needed it is likely to be so difficult channel conditions that the assumption that CS is detected by every node is wrong.\r\n\r\nThe assumption that one single factory network will contain 200 battery-powered nodes is not realistic. A real factory network will have wired power to most of its sensors and actuators, so even if wireless communication is preferred, the energy issue will only be important for a small subset of the nodes.\r\n\r\nThe paper starts out with a motivation about &#34;recent&#34; demands that is supported by 13 to 14 years old self-references. This is neither proper nor very convincing.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, there are several irrelevant self-references that should be removed before any publication.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, the authors fail to convince me that their solution is relevant to factory automation, and several of the assumptions are plain wrong from a factory perspective. The suggested solution seems much more suitable for a consumer IoT network than for an industrial sensor network.", "write_date": "2016-06-01T19:39:58Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.161", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 105, "fields": {"subject": "Tuan - IEEE ETFA 2016", "content": "----------------------- REVIEW 1 ---------------------\r\nPAPER: 161\r\nTITLE: Collaborative Transmission Schemes in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks\r\nAUTHORS: Trong Tuan Nguyen and Dong-Seong Kim\r\n\r\n\r\n----------- Review -----------\r\nThis is useful paper with a careful and detailed comparative analysis of energy-efficiency and performance parameters of a wireless sensor network. Such papers are always welcome.\r\n\r\nThe results are shown only by modelling and simulation. This is adequate for a conference paper but the results need to be verified in a practical demonstration. The simulation can only measure what you code into it, but a real practical demonstration will always have additional physical influences that have not been captured by a model.

Although the idea of combining the advantages of the two standard bus technologies is interesting, the comparison between the proposed DCS and traditional DCSes lack of convincing perspectives. The results implemented in the testbed case satisfy the standard of the IACS, however there are many factors needed to be considered if the proposed system can be realized, for example, cost of systems, complication level of system, etc.\r\n\r\nMany equations in the paper should be explained in detail for further understandable flow of reading. They must be cited if they are adopted from the literature or they should be defined clearly. It is better if the authors use a table to summarize all the terms/notation used in the articles.\r\nAll the figures should be modified for clear reading. The flow charts for the algorithms/block diagrams could be altered to be bigger.

The first part of the system model is not clear. In Fig. 2, the angle \\phi_{1r} is defined as the angles between N_i^{(n-1)\\tao} - N_i^{n\\tao} and N_i^{(n-1)\\tao} &#8211; S. The definition of \\phi_{2r} is similar. But the random movement only require one random angle.\r\n2. In the figures, x and y are used to denote the x-axis and y-axis coordinates. In (1), x and y are used to denote the transmitting and receiving signals. It is confused.\r\n3. In (2), N_{sn_i}/2 is defined as the variance of n_{sn_i}. The SNR should be 2P_s|h_{sn_i}|^2/ N_{sn_i}. Besides, why the noise power is related to the transmitter? The noise power at N_i should be independent to the transmitter.\r\n4. The equations (3) and (4) are not clear. In (3), the channel coefficient is divided into two parts: the pathloss and fast fading. But in (4), the pathloss is calculated with the unit of dB. The expressions in (3) and (4) are incompatible.\r\n5. The basic assumption of this paper is difficult to understand. The value of the work cannot be evaluated.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewing: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper proposed a TDMA-based cooperative relaying scheme that considers the dynamic link quality of assistant nodes. It is shown through simulation that significant performance can be achieved compared with schemes without dynamic link quality considered.\r\nThe problems of the paper are as follows:\r\n1) Most of the ideas and analysis were already seen in the publication of reference [13]. No new ideas are proposed in the paper.\r\n2) There are too many ideal assumptions in the analysis that make the scheme not practical, e.g., no signaling overhead considered in the computation of the SNR, TDMA based resource allocation for assistant nodes, and no interference considered.\r\n3) For algorithms 2 & 3, please give more explanation why main-assistant and sub-assistant nodes are used. It seems they have the same functions.\r\n4) There are also some not typical symbols used that are confusing to readers, e.g., the u in equation (24) is packet size (TABLE I shows), why use the word epoch, t is number of assistant nodes.\r\n5) Please explain why there are crossover in the curves of figure 12.\r\n6) Actually eCoRSS is not practical and hard to be implemented, not as the conclusion said.", "write_date": "2016-08-12T10:16:44Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.161", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 110, "fields": {"subject": "Syamsul - [Journal of Network and Computer Applications]", "content": "Ms. Ref.

Provide a rationale for your rating, and suggested improvements (if appropriate).\r\n\r\nAuthors propose a pub/sub based WSN architecture for water quality monitoring. Authors implemented their architecture using Arduino platforms. They concluded that water temperature is inversely proportional to dissolved oxygen and pH value.\r\nEventhought authors carried out heavy experiments, the results of this work would be more interesting for agronomy community.\r\nThere exist many quality monitoring platforms, so it is not clear from this paper what is original except the conclusion that water temperature is inversely proportional to dissolved oxygen and pH value. Also there is no performance evaluation from networking perspective of the proposed architecture.\r\n\r\n> *** Familiarity: Rate your familiarity with the topic of the paper.\r\nWorking in this area of research (2)\r\n\r\n> *** Relevance to the track and timeliness: Rate the importance and timeliness of the topic addressed in the paper within its area of research.\r\nLittle (4)\r\n\r\n> *** Technical content and scientific rigour: Rate the technical content of the paper, its scientific rigour and novelty.\r\nMarginal work and simple contribution.

Are they proposing the &#34;must have&#34; of the best solution for this specific problem or are they simply providing some hints on pros and cons of the different available solutions. Not even the abstract gives any indication about this.\r\n\r\nThen, according to the aims of the authors, they should restructure the paper focusing on a more elaborated description of the proposal and of the evaluation, giving the proper details of the approach used. \r\n\r\nMoreover, another point that is very lightly treated but that should require more input is on the issues and cost of implementing this types of solutions\r\n\r\n> *** Familiarity: Rate your familiarity with the topic of the paper.\r\nWorking in this area of research (2)\r\n\r\n> *** Relevance to the track and timeliness: Rate the importance and timeliness of the topic addressed in the paper within its area of research.\r\nGood (2)\r\n\r\n> *** Technical content and scientific rigour: Rate the technical content of the paper, its scientific rigour and novelty.\r\nMarginal work and simple contribution.

Provide a rationale for your rating, and suggested improvements (if appropriate).\r\n\r\nThe authors have implemented a water quality monitoring system using a wireless sensor network with the pub/sub architecture. Tests were conducted in an aquarium and confirm the relationship between temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH level.\r\n\r\nThe main contribution is the implementation.\r\n\r\nThe authors should present results related to wireless networking. They state that &#34;Motivated by those problems and challenges, this paper is aimed at determining the quality of water based on the measurements of oxygen, temperature, and pH value of the water.&#34;. This is related to chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe authors state that &#34;This pub/sub architecture combined with wireless communication using ZigBee protocol shows the main uniqueness of this paper.&#34;, but the reviewer sees no strong contribution in this. Moreover, the authors state that &#34;Hence, characteristics of wireless sensor networks to remote water quality monitoring needs to be studied based on the type of sensors required to monitor water quality, availability of bandwidth and frequent disconnection, quality of service required (QoS) on data transmission, urgency of transmission, and transmission data types.&#34;, but no results about these characteristics are presented.\r\n\r\nCircuit diagrams are not presented in a detailed way.\r\n\r\nThe experiments are very simple. It seems that just one run was executed. The authors must present mean values of several runs of the experiments, including the variance of the results; e.g., confidence intervals, as this may change conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe paper must be carefully reviewed. There are several odd expressions. There are no units in Figure 8.\r\n\r\nOther issues:\r\n- What do you mean by &#34;One of the work reported that by using publisher and subscriber, network communication can be more efficient in case of round-trip latency and bandwidth&#34;?\r\n- Please review some &#34;strong sentences&#34; such as &#34;The system runs on HTTP protocol for this interface, which is complementary to the ZigBee protocol used for communication among relay and gateway nodes as explained in hardware architecture, and in turn make the system works perfectly.&#34; and &#34;These checkings were performed more than once and it is revealed that the system can work perfectly.&#34;.\r\n\r\n> *** Familiarity: Rate your familiarity with the topic of the paper.\r\nTruly expert in this area of research (1)\r\n\r\n> *** Relevance to the track and timeliness: Rate the importance and timeliness of the topic addressed in the paper within its area of research.\r\nAcceptable (3)\r\n\r\n> *** Technical content and scientific rigour: Rate the technical content of the paper, its scientific rigour and novelty.\r\nQuestionable work with severe flaws.

Provide a rationale for your rating, and suggested improvements (if appropriate).\r\n\r\nThis paper considers the problem of faulty node detection in wireless sensor networks. To detect faulty nodes, the authors argue for the use of a Markov chain model. Thus, an a sound analytic modeling is provided and extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of their approach.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the paper is very well written. Both grammar and the style of included figures are convincing and the story is easy to follow. I also like to mention that the problem statement and the discussion of related approaches is straightforward and helps the reader to get into the paper.\r\n\r\nThe topic addressed by the paper is relevant to the WD conference. Moreover, the performance evaluation seems to show better results in terms of faulty node detection and miss-detection rate.\r\n\r\nDespite of that, the degree of novelty of the paper is quite limited. Indeed, such topics have been well studied in the literature, over which many key papers are missing from the citation list. More importantly, in the existing results much more generalized optimization formulation exists. Just Google-Scholar search “WSN, fault node detection”, the list of relevant papers will be there.\r\n\r\nI would suggest comparing the performance of the proposed design with more recent works. Indeed, the authors quote many papers, but are not able to relate to them, yet they assume that their strategy outperforms others.\r\n\r\nIt would be much more convincing to add the confidence intervals for the curves. I also think that averaged results of 50 or 100 simulation runs (for e.g.) presented with confidence intervals will improve some conclusions in the paper.\r\n\r\n> *** Familiarity: Rate your familiarity with the topic of the paper.\r\nTruly expert in this area of research (1)\r\n\r\n> *** Relevance to the track and timeliness: Rate the importance and timeliness of the topic addressed in the paper within its area of research.\r\nAcceptable (3)\r\n\r\n> *** Technical content and scientific rigour: Rate the technical content of the paper, its scientific rigour and novelty.\r\nValid work but limited contribution.

The proposed scheme aims at reducing energy consumption of the nodes. Presented simulation results show that the protocol outperforms previously proposed solutions. The paper is well-written, it is easy to follow and understand. However, a set of things has to be improved before it can be accepted.\r\n\r\nResearch goal and contributions:\r\n\r\nFirst, the research goal of the paper has to be explained better. It is stated that the goal of the work is to develop an energy-aware routing protocol for industrial IoT applications, but more motivation is needed. In general, in industrial applications the main requirements to communication systems are reliability, availability and timeliness. Current paper looks at the possibilities of energy consumption decrease instead and thus more explanations and examples of particular applications in mind are needed. Next, it is said that the paper focuses on IoT and not IWSANs as IoT covers larger areas and number of devices. But it has to be explained more clearly why protocols developed for IWSANs cannot be scaled to IoT and why new protocols are needed. And, given that, contributions of the paper and the differences between ERRS and previously proposed protocols have to be explained better. As it is stated in the paper, cluster selection algorithm used is very similar to the ones from references 1, 7 and 13, while the routing scheme is close to 21. The new features added in this work have to be highlighted better. \r\n\r\nProtocol design:\r\n\r\nDue to periodic nature of transmitted packets and to guarantee deterministic delays, TDMA is often used in industry (and in wireless standards developed for industry, such as WirelessHART, ISA 100.11a and WIA-PA), while the current paper adopts CSMA/CA. This choice has to be explained since CSMA cannot guaranty predictable channel access delays, which means that deadlines can be missed and industrial requirements on timeliness might not be fulfilled. \r\n\r\nMoreover, it is said in the paper that CH collects the readings from several sensors before one aggregated packet is sent to the gateway. This will save energy spent on packet transmissions, but will increase latency for packets that arrive to CH early and have to wait before all the other data is collected. This trade-off between energy and time has to be discusses as well, as in industrial systems requirement on real-time communication is more important than on energy saving. \r\n\r\nTransmission order in the routing scheme should be explained more clearly. It is said that when one CH sends RREQ, its neighbors reply with a message including their hop count to the GW. To do so they should know the hop count. This means that the GW should start this initiation process, or? And the last sentence in Section II.B is confusing. Algorithm 2 is followed only once in the initiation stage, not for every data packet, or?\r\n\r\nAlso, only one path is selected by the proposed protocol, while industrial systems often require redundant paths to ensure system’s availability in case of failures (e.g., as stated in [1], WirelessHART requires every sensor node to have at least two available paths towards the gateway). How will the protocol behave in case of a link or node failure? Will the network operation have to stop to establish new routes? This has to be discussed in the paper since system’s reliability and availability are the key requirements in industrial systems. \r\n\r\nPerformance evaluation:\r\n\r\nMoving to the results section, simulation model should be explained better. No scheduling is mentioned anywhere. It is said that different clusters can be allocated different channels, but no reference for suitable channel allocation scheme is given. And during the set-up phase clusters are not known yet and thus nodes will interfere with each other when trying to create the clusters. \r\n\r\nMoreover, simulation setup has to be explained in more details. How and how many data packets were sent? How many transmission rounds were simulated? How many different node placements were tested and do the presented results show the data for one placement or an average for several placements? Comparing different placements, do they all show the same performance or are there any unlucky ones (e.g., since the nodes are placed randomly, is it possible that there are I/O devices that are located too far away to hear any router?)? Which exactly channel model was used and were channel conditions stable during the simulations? How would the protocols behave if channel conditions were changing over time (which is often the case in harsh industrial environments)?\r\n\r\nNext, the proposed protocol is compared with three existing ones. References to the protocols are given, but it would be good to add short descriptions as well, so that the reader is not forced to go to the mentioned papers. And it is especially important to describe the differences since it is stated that the proposed scheme is very similar to the one from reference 21. Also, on page 8 it is said that scheme in 21 supports only single-hop communication. Is it so? And if yes, then maybe it would be better to compare the proposed scheme with protocols supporting multi-hop? \r\n\r\nSimulations were done only for one size of the operating area. What if the nodes were placed in a smaller area, e.g., 100*100 m, would the compared schemes perform in the same way? If the benefit of ERRS is better performance in large-scale deployments, it would be interesting to see the borders of where it starts and stops outperforming the other schemes. \r\n\r\nAlso, it is shown that the proposed protocols outperforms the other ones in terms of energy consumption, but does it provide the same reliability? It would be interesting to see that, e.g., packet reception rate in not degraded due to different route selection scheme. \r\n\r\nAnd it would be good to add more explanations to the figures with the results, e.g. why energy consumption decreases with time in Fig. 8? Why do so many nodes run out of battery after only 900 seconds of simulation in Fig. 10? In industry the devices typically work 24 / 7 and it is not possible to change batteries too often. \r\n\r\nOverall paper comments:\r\n\r\nDescription of IEEE 802.15.4 is spread between System model and Results sections, which might be confusing for the readers. It is good to have simulation parameters in the Results section, but general overview of the standard would fit better in Section II.C (which should probably be renamed to “IEEE 802.15.4a overview”, since it is stated that 802.15.4a and not pure 802.15.4 was used).\r\n\r\nThe paper has a lot of figures and algorithms which makes it very easy to follow. However, it exceeds TII page limit and has to be shortened. One way to do it could be to remove some of the figures and algorithms. \r\n- For example, Fig. 2 can be removed since all three topologies are most probably known to the readers, star and mesh topologies are not mentioned anywhere else in the paper and cluster-tree can be explained using Fig. 1 if needed. \r\n- Next, Fig. 3 and 6 are very similar to each other. It would be fine to keep only one of them or remove both since they are well described in the text. \r\n- Fig. 4 and 6 could be removed as well as the text explained processes well. If they are kept, they should be moved closer to the corresponding text. And in Fig. 6, should CLU-MEM-RES message be named CLU-MEM-ACK instead (as it is called so in the text)? And it is slightly confusing that in Fig. 4 CLU-ROU-IND is sent from the CH to I/O devices, while in Fig. 6 is it sent in the opposite direction. Maybe one of the messages can be renamed then?\r\n- Algorithm 2 is very well described in the text and thus can be removed. If kept, it should be moved much closer to the corresponding text. \r\n\r\nMoreover, there are quite few typos and grammar errors in the paper. Some examples are below:\r\npage 1, left column, line 26: … an increase in the number …\r\npage 1, left column, lines 39-40: … all sensor nodes use limited battery sources …\r\npage 1, left column, line 49: Clustering has been proven …\r\npage 2, left column, line 36: … cannot communicate with each other directly …\r\npage 2, left column, line 55: … transmit k-bits long packet …\r\npage 5, left column, eq. 8: Sk should probably be replaced with Sa?\r\npage 6, left column, line 46: The gateways acted as (remove “the”) PAN coordinators and … \r\npage 6, Table II: There must be a typo in data rate of 11Mbps \r\n\r\n[1] D.

Related to the Industrial IoT (IIoT), the paper only considers the hierarchical framework that contains I/O devices, routers, and gateways. These elements are widely used in all traditional networks. \r\n\r\nThe main drawback of this manuscript is that the technical novelty is very low compared to previous well-studied work. The proposed method is not clear how the energy consumption is reduced. Only hop-count is not enough to validate low-latency transmission. According to my understanding, the paper considers hop-count, cluster formation, and select the lowest consumption path to design the proposed method. \r\n\r\nHow the power saving constraints are satisfied is not very clear from the manuscript. Although, joint min-hop-count and least energy is used, however, the results are not validated in bounds by experiments or analytical results. \r\n\r\nThe authors deliberately consider the scheme that does not necessarily consider both real-time and energy-efficient scheme for the comparison. However, there are tremendous amount of work that consider both. Author should compare their results with the state-of-the-art. \r\n\r\nThe related discussion in performance evaluation section is very weak. No insights are presented. \r\n\r\nIn Fig. 9, how the distance from sensing layer to the convergence layer affect the performance is well discussed. \r\n\r\nMinor Comments: \r\nTwo times ‘Communication energy’ in table II. Please use different notation. \r\nLots of jargon, e.g., MIMO\r\nIn (1), $E_{elec}$ is not properly defined? What do the authors mean by ‘energy consumed to process the data’? Some other terms need to be properly discussed. \r\nThe optimization condition in (6) is very straight forward. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 5\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper is focus on the routing algorithm which takes energy consumption as a very import factor in IoT based on IEEE 802.15.4a. The proposed algorithm is targeted at large-scale systems where data are aggregated through different clusters on their way to the sink. A hierarchical system framework is employed to promote scalability of IoT elements. By estimating the residual energy and hop counts for each path, it said that the data can be forwarded to the destination through the optimal path by Simulation. It is very good works in the field of Industrial IoT.\r\n\r\nA lot of works and reference can be found about IoT routing, in order to highlight the new contribution of this paper, the authors are suggested to test the proposed method and algorithm in a real industry application. At the same time, to compare the proposed algorithm’s performance with other method if possible. \r\n\r\nIn addition, some works bout energy-ware in IoT application is suggested to be investigated to highlight the new contribution and new potential application. E.g., the following publication in TII:\r\nInternet of Things in product life-cycle energy management\r\nJournal of Industrial Information Integration 2016\r\nIoT based intelligent perception and access of manufacturing resource towards cloud manufacturing\r\nIEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics 2014\r\nInternet of Things and BOM based life cycle Assessment of Energy-Saving and Emission-Reduction of Product\r\nIEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics 10 (2)\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 6\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper presents how to model a power consumption of large-scale Wireless Sensors Network where base stations are gateways uploading data to the Internet. The results are interesting and may deserve publication, but revision of text to improve the quality of presentation would be valuable. Please find my comments about the text below. I would recommend to both; proofread the text carefully to make the text clearer and seek assistance from mathematician and engineer to improve the theoretical and experimental aspects.\r\n\r\nI.\tProofread and revise the text. Pay attention to what is said. For example:\r\n1.\tThe title promises; “Energy-aware Real-time Routing for Large-scale Industrial Internet of Things” \r\nIn fact, the work is devoted mainly to research and discuss the results of modeling an energy-aware routing in the large-scale Wireless Sensors Network, where base stations are gateways uploading data to the Internet.\r\nBoth, the proposed model (Section II), as well as the presented energy-aware routing scheme (Section III), and also described performance evaluation (Section IV), does not contain anything, it was specific to the Industrial IoT. If Industrial IoT matters, please take this into account in the system model and the proposed routing algorithm. If not, please consider amending the title, so that it corresponds to the contents of the work.\r\n\r\n2.\tMathematical formulas in chapter II (System model) and chapter III (Routing scheme) need more attention. \r\nFormula (3), router energy consumption Er fragment; first component Erx(k) according to formula (2) consists of “… energy for aggregation and compression” (see line just below the formula (2)).\r\nSo, the k in next component (the sum over indices with z, j, from 1 to M) should be different!\r\nFormula (3), symbols M, O, (see line just below formula (3)) “… is the number of neighbor nodes of router r…”. Symbols M, O are different, please specify the differences. The same concerns symbols z, j in second component of Er !\r\nFormula (5), Eround should be the sum of all clusters (not only one Ecluster,i). Moreover, Eg and Er are calculated in clusters, so in formula (5) that fact should be taken into account.\r\nIf comments above are valid, in the formula (5) where L>1, it is necessary to preclude the multiple counting of the same components Erj,i\r\nFormula (7), two lines below we read “… W is the number of I/O devices …” Whether, it should be added: “in the cluster j “ ? Moreover, so far (formulas (3,4 and text) for determining the number of I/O devices within cluster, the symbol N was used.\r\nFormula (11), how to calculate this? Please explain, how to establish the set {hop counts}. It is crucial element of routing procedure!\r\n\r\n3.\tRouting scheme ERRS in chapter III.\r\n1). Set-up phase.\r\nPage 4, line 51, column left; “…and position information …” \r\nPage 4, line 52, column right; “… residual energy …”\r\nPage 5, line 37, column left; “… message containing its… hop count …”\r\nPage 6, lines 49-52, column left; “… all nodes were in the carrier sensing range …”\r\nPlease specify clearly (e.g. in the chapter system models) ALL assumptions that have been made, and are relevant to the issues under consideration.\r\n\r\n2). Fig.4, “…Updating routing table and calculating transmission power …”. Does it make sense to calculate routing table for I/O devices (there is only one hop to the cluster head)? \r\nTransmission power, whether residual energy, or energy necessary for communication within cluster? Please explain where these calculated values are later used.\r\n\r\n3). Fig.5, CLU-MEM-RES what is it! Whether should be: CRE-CLU-ACK? CLU-ROU-IND on this figure has opposite direction to that on fig.4. Moreover, this direction does not match the description in text (page 4, lines 54-55, column left).\r\n\r\n4). Please ensure compatibility of flow diagram at Figure 5, with the one that was shown at Figure 4 and described on page 4. As far as Figure 4 is understandable, the figure 5 requires a major improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\tGeneral and detailed remarks.\r\n\r\n1.\tPlease explain the main idea of this contribution, arising from the practical observations or theoretical conclusions. Please provide the rationale of proposed algorithm concerning the aspects described below\r\n-\tWe have energy model (on page 2) where the energy consumed is proportional to distance squared, or even distance raised to the fourth power (see formula (1)). But selecting factor is inversely proportional to distance (not squared or raised to the fourth power).\r\n-\tHop counts estimating (see abstract, formula 11, algorithm 2). Where and how it is implemented in the algorithm 2? What amount of energy spends node on hop counts calculation and communication necessary to inform the neighbors of them?\r\n-\tPotential next-hop. Where ( in the algorithm 2) and how proposed method ensures, that selection of next-hop approaching us to the gateway?\r\n-\tThe proposed approach; favors a small clusters and ignores (see formula (6)) the exchange, between cluster heads, of routing information (what is a pivot activity in real-time routing) during the operation of the network. Small clusters and additional exchange of information increase the number of collisions, and therefore repetition of packages, and increasing energy consumption, but these costs in the objective function (6) are not included. \r\n\r\n2.\tThe algorithm 1, page 5, Determine the potential gateway to complete the route; is trivial and may be defined in one sentence: Of the gateways in the neighborhood, select the closest one.\r\n3.\tThe algorithm 2, page 8, Determine the potential next-hop to forward data packets.\r\n-\tstep 8; how to calculate d-rAr i}? \r\n-\tstep 10; brackets {} means set (see steps 11,15), but what does it mean ri.{drri} and ri.{Erri}? \r\n-\tsteps 9-12; During the network lifetime, as time goes on, neighbors who are closer will have less energy than those farther on (because they were more often chosen as a relay) and therefore the condition in Step10 will be increasingly difficult to fulfill. As a result, in spite of that we have neighbors who may be next-hop in routing, the condition in Step10 not met and set NH will be empty. \r\n-\tsteps 14-16; loop FOR i … is useless. Step 15 is one operation (see formula (11)), that does not depend on i !\r\n-\tstep 15; where (I didn’t see in the algorithm) and how to calculate hop counts ?\r\n\r\n4.\tPage 7, lines 48-49, column right; “It is evident that the energy consumption of I/O devices\r\nis reduced significantly by all four routing schemes.” Scientifically it sounds bad. What does it mean reduced significantly? Compared to what?\r\n5.\tEngineering and experimental aspects. \r\nIn simulation nodes are distributed randomly (see Fig.7 title). Please determine on figures 8-12, the maximal inaccuracy of presented results. What was the impact of number (ratio) of gateways and routers and I/O sensors, on final results?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully, that these remarks allow to improve this work. \r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 7\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis is a very good manuscript. I can see only two serious issues:\r\n\r\n1) The assumption that all nodes can sense the other node carrier (made to avoid the hidden node problem) - it does diminish the realism of the situation. Also, simulation of the wireless communication signal in non-open space (there is no assumption whether this is open space or indoor environment) cannot be realistic due to the multipath problem. The assumptions need to be clarified and their impact on the realisticness of the simulation has to be discussed. \r\n\r\n2) The manuscript is too long. I believe that this journal has an eight page limit for manuscripts unless a manuscript is state-of-the-art. This is not state-of-the-art manuscript (only 21 citations). Hence it needs to be significantly shortened.\r\n\r\nAE Comments:\r\nAssociate Editor\r\nComments to the Author:\r\nThe submitted manuscript is good.

The main concept is that stations use individual OFDM subcarriers to send their CTS and ACKs concurrently, thus allowing fast acknowledged multicast transmission. This is a useful method in some industrial scenarios. Unfortunately, the detailed description of the Algorithms is partly unclear, thus I can only recommend weakly to accept this submission. If the submission is accepted, the descriptions must be improved for final submission, addressing the listed comments below, most importantly comments no.7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.      Eq(1): replace Tb (= bit duration) by Rb (= bit rate). j and l are unclear. Anyway, best to remove (1), it is not used further.\r\n2.      II.B: delete “In real-time networks”\r\n3.      II.B: delete last sentence “For instance, in 64QAM, the receiver could incorrectly decode the symbol, even when a symbol shifts slightly with respect to the axes.” (bad wording not worth fixing)\r\n4.      II.D: “... without any deviation from the standard frame format.” (delete, unclear wording not worth fixing)\r\n5.      II.D: replace “tactical” by “real-time”\r\n6.      III.A: How are C_ID and S_ID assigned to each station?\r\n7.      III.A: “First, the transmitter calculates the average RSSI..”: Average over all CTSs received earlier from this station on its subcarrier frequency, or average over all stations in this sector? What is R(i), does it refer to user i, or sector i?\r\n8.      III.A: “.. to transmit the data to the users whose SID are recorded..”: using multicast or unicast?\r\n9.      III.B: “The orthogonality of each subcarrier ensures the safety of transmission..”: With OFDMA, this requires precisely synchronized transmissions from stations. How to ensure this? What if the unknown propagation times (distances) differ?. Replace &#34;safety&#34; -> &#34;reliability&#34;\r\n10.     III.C, eqn(1): Optimization with respect to the rates R(i)s? Trivially, just take the maximum allowed R(i) ? Explain what prevents this solution? If  the selected D is too small, there may be no feasible solution to the optimization problem. Algorithm 2 doesn’t seem to optimize, but searches for feasible values, and stops transmision if the required rate would be > Mmax. Please clarify!\r\n11.     Eqn(1), delete superfluous “=”.\r\n12.     below eqn(3): R(i) refers to sector i, while in Algorithm 1 it was R(i) for station i?\r\n13.     “users”: Here, &#34;user&#34; = &#34;station&#34; in earlier paragraphs.  Use consistent terminology!\r\n14.     Algorithm 2: What is N? How is D(i) calculated: what values to select for payload size P and processing times in (2)? What is ra(i,R[i])? a real number or a set? What is script R?\r\n15.     Algorithm 2: “Start retransmission”: retransmission per unicast? or multicast?\r\n16.     Eqn(4): How is epsilon Rx determined, what values does it take? What are alpha i and alpha i prime, and where do they enter the algorithm?\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------- REVIEW 2 ---------------------\r\nPAPER: 29\r\nTITLE: Dynamic Rate Adaptation Scheme for Industrial Wireless Networks using RSSI\r\nAUTHORS: Syamsul Rizal, Jin-Yong Im, Jae-Min Lee and Dong-Seong Kim\r\n\r\nOverall evaluation: -3 (strong reject)\r\n\r\n----------- Overall evaluation ----------- In this paper authors propose a rate adaptation algorithm for multicast communication in wireless industrial networks. In particular, the presented solution checks the network condition using the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) within the clear-to-send (CTS) frames. Moreover, the proposed algorithm has been evaluated using simulation.\r\n\r\nThe paper has to be reject because its contents are practically the same presented in “Rate adaptation algorithm for multicast communication in tactical networks” published in: Military Communications Conference, MILCOM 2015 - 2015 IEEE.\r\nOnly some new introductory sections have been added, but no new research results. Most of the sections have been written using cut&paste. Then, same algorithms and same figures to show algorithm evaluation.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------- REVIEW 3 ---------------------\r\nPAPER: 29\r\nTITLE: Dynamic Rate Adaptation Scheme for Industrial Wireless Networks using RSSI\r\nAUTHORS: Syamsul Rizal, Jin-Yong Im, Jae-Min Lee and Dong-Seong Kim\r\n\r\nOverall evaluation: -2 (reject)\r\n\r\n----------- Overall evaluation ----------- The paper targets wireless sensor networks that transmit data to multiple users, targeting industrial sensor networks.\r\nThe method adjusts the modulation scheme based on feedback collected from the receiver nodes. That way the transmission quality is controlled.\r\nSimulations are performed to evaluate the proposed approach.\r\n\r\nThe addressed problem is valuable in order to enable wireless technologies in timing critical applications.\r\nThe paper provides a lot of background information which seems not always needed.\r\nThis makes it hard to filter the relevant content.\r\nAlso many places lack citations in Section 2.\r\n\r\nThe main contribution is in the System Model section which is confusing, as the system model is usually given.\r\nRestructuring the paper into system model (what is mostly in the section 2) and a dedicated section on the proposed method, would present the contribution better.\r\n\r\nWhile evaluations are performed, the setup is not clear to me. How many simulation runs were performed, and what is shown in the graph? (if average values, then the STD would be good to add.)\r\n\r\nOther comments:\r\n- Abstract: &#34;This paper proposed...&#34; -> &#34;This paper proposes...&#34;\r\n- Abstract: &#34;...modify the frames in MAC layer...&#34; -> &#34;...in the MAC...&#34;\r\n- Abstract: &#34;...in terms of reduced the delay...&#34; -> &#34;...reduced delay...&#34;\r\n- Section 1: &#34;For sensor networks application...&#34; -> &#34;For sensor network applications...&#34;\r\n- Section 1: &#34;...as the most common topology in sensor networks in the mesh or ad-hoc network.&#34; -> &#34;...is the...&#34; and a citation would be good to back the claim.\r\n- Section 1: &#34;These limitations result in the inability of the transmitter to send high-quality data in a short time.&#34; What is high quality data?

Besides, many grammar errors and typos were found.\r\n\r\nSection III B) (UWB channel modeling) is confusing and should be better explained in order to better understand\r\n\r\nAs an example:\r\n&#34;The UWB channel can support large bandwidth and some conventional channel models but they did not consider the new effect which arises as a result of such large bandwidth&#34;\r\n\r\nwhat are these effects ?\r\n\r\nNext:\r\n\r\n&#34;The central unit theorem is also not applicable here because only a few multipath components will overlap with each other. Rayleigh is not used for small scale fading, it is recommended to use log normal or Nakagami distribution TG3a recommended using lognormal distribution for the multipath gain magnitude&#34;.\r\n\r\nWhat is the relationship between the central unit theorem and multipath here? The authors should give more explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthors proposed and implemented the Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) approach. However, no reference to this approach is presented.\r\nHence, it is difficult for a reader to understand how the approach works, what both cluster and ray arrival rates stand for, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the reference you need include:\r\n\r\n@ARTICLE{1146527,\r\nauthor={A.

The problem is not very well formulated, and the related works more or less unrelated as no relay selection papers are cited.The proposed scheme is very briefly described. It is stated that CTS (without defining what CTS is) is used for potential relay nodes to identify themselves. Next it is stated that direct transmission or relaying is selected on the basis of BER, but there is no explanation on how this BER is obtained for different links. Nor is the complexity of the BER assessment or how a specific relay is notified that it was selected. Hence, the main contribution is not explained at all in the paper. Next, the UWB channel model is explained without any references or explanations as to why the channel model looks like it does. Nor is it explained how it is used to assess the BER of different links. Finally, a confusing Matlab evaluation is given, and several figures co!\r\n ntaining only one curve (!) in each is given, but no explanation about how this evaluation relates to the contribution is given.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------- REVIEW 4 ---------------------\r\nPAPER: 31\r\nTITLE: Analyzing the Optimal Channel paths in Ultra-Wide Band networks:Applicable to Avionic Systems.\r\nAUTHORS: Williams Nwadiugwu and Dong-Seong Kim\r\n\r\nOverall evaluation: -2 (reject)\r\n\r\n----------- Overall evaluation ----------- The focus of the paper does not fit the conference.\r\n\r\nThe topic (UWB communication between system elements) may fit WFCS, although the paper&#39;s target is to discuss channel distributions and to verify that there is a possible parametric model solution for the problem, with the Saleh-Valenzuela approach. Given that UWB is suitable for avionic systems in general, the authors nicely fit a four channel models with different parameters, and compare the results briefly. The results in Figures are not compared and discussed with enough detail.\r\n\r\nThere are a few disturbing typos (?) in the paper, e.g. using &#34;db&#34; instead of dB in many places.\r\nThe title of the referenced papers 1 and 11 starts with low caps.\r\nThe paper title is missing a space character after the &#34;:&#34;, ends with a (.), and don&#39;t use proper capitalization (&#34;paths&#34; and &#34;networks&#34; should start with capital letters).", "write_date": "2017-04-21T10:49:14Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.118", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 123, "fields": {"subject": "Alif - IEEE LANMAN 2017", "content": "Dear Mr. Pranata\r\n\r\nWe are delighted to inform you that your paper &#34;Towards an IoT-based Water Quality Monitoring System with Brokerless Pub/Sub Architecture&#34; http://edas.info/showPaper.php?m=1570349363 has been accepted for publication as a long paper (6 pages) in IEEE LANMAN&#39;17.

Why should the paper be accepted?\r\n\r\nIn this paper, the authors propose a brokerless publication/subscription architecture for the water quality monitoring system.

By compared with the existing solutions, the authors demonstrate that the performance of their system is better than the existing ones.\r\n\r\n> *** Weaknesses: What are the most important reasons NOT to accept this paper?\r\n\r\nThe structure of the paper is not very reasonable. The experimental part takes the major space of the paper, and the algorithms listed in the paper do not fully explain. \r\n\r\nSome of the items listed in the paper do not make sense. For examples, Table 3 compare the prices with two of existing solutions. However, the paper is not to provide a cost-effective solution, what is the point for making such comparison within such limited space? Moreover, if the price difference is made by employing MQTT, then such comparison is also acceptable. However, it doesn&#39;t seem to Reviewer the authors mean that as well. \r\n\r\nThe take home message is not clear to Reviewer, since the authors sometimes want to demonstrate the quality of the water monitoring is good, and sometimes want to show the system performance is better than MQTT-based system.\r\n\r\n> *** Summary and Comments: Brief summary and comments to the authors. Especially in the case of a negative recommendation, please explain why the paper is not good enough.\r\n\r\nThe organization/structure of the paper is not reasonable, the authors need to modify it and make sure the paper content matches the topic/research question more closely.\r\n\r\n======= Review 3 =======\r\n\r\n> *** Familiarity: Please assess your familiarity with the subject matter of the paper\r\nFamiliar with this area of research (3)\r\n\r\n> *** Novelty: Assess the originality of the work and its contribution to the area of research\r\nVariation of a known concept (3)\r\n\r\n> *** Recommendation: Should the paper be accepted or rejected?\r\nDefinite accept (5)\r\n\r\n> *** Strengths: What are the major contributions of this paper?

Especially in the case of a negative recommendation, please explain why the paper is not good enough.\r\n\r\nSec I introduces and motivates well, why water-quality is important, it needs a bit the technology arguments, why IoT is the way to go to make such a problem solvable and secure! \r\n\r\nThe need for a real-time version may benefit from a clear argument, too.\r\n\r\nRelated work in Sec II may need some clearly measurable dimensions against which you compare your approach. Thus, the MQTT solution should be discussed, too. \r\n\r\nA bit surprising is the fact that Sec III does start with MQTT approach and not the pub/sub one - why? The reason for selecting Arduinos is not well clear. The device&#39;s architecture is good. \r\n\r\nThe analysis in Sec IV is great - and the economic dimension very convincing. But the selection of exactly those sensors is not well explained. \r\n\r\nFinally, Sec V does contain a summary, but no conclusions - thus, either change the section&#39;s title or add real conclusions, which show that your approach benefits a use case, people, etc - all that is missing.", "write_date": "2017-04-21T11:57:24Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.64", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 124, "fields": {"subject": "Dahye Kim - WFCS 2017", "content": "Review 1\r\n\r\nThe paper discusses a load balancing scheme for multi-controller on SDNs.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the paper suffers from a serious issue concerning the the level of contribution and delta with respect to the authors&#39; recent paper published in INDIN conference 2016.

It is relevant for WiP-T8 since the approach proposed can be considered for intelligent sensors and sensor networks. The following issues should be addressed before publication:\r\n- It is good for the Abstract to be just a paragraph and not two paragraphs.\r\n- Second paragraph of the introduction and the paragraph in section IV are too long. Each of them should be divided at least into two paragraphs.\r\n- All the acronyms should follow the same format, i.e. all lower cases for their expanded words or all first word letters in capital.\r\n- Figures and tables should be cited before they are placed in the document.\r\n- The description of the research problem to be tackled should be improved since it is not clear when authors introduce the scalability issue.\r\n- It would be good to have a brief paragraph describing the structure/organization of the paper just by end of the introduction section.\r\n- Middleware is a widely accepted word in the community. So, middle-ware does not need to be written in that way.\r\n- Citation and reference formats are not according to the IEEE standard format. They should be revised.\r\n- The English language in the paper should be improved.", "write_date": "2017-06-17T10:39:24Z", "update_date": "2017-06-17T10:55:55Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 127, "fields": {"subject": "Seung-Han - ETFA 2017", "content": "Review 1\r\nOverall evaluation: -1\r\n\r\nThe paper deals with the design of a FPGA implementing a subset of the MIL-1553B standard.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the presentation of the work done by the authors stay at a very general level.\r\nHence, the reading of the paper has a limited interest. \r\n\r\nIn addition, there are many English mistakes making the paper difficult to read. The ideas are not clearly expressed. Please clarify them.\r\n\r\nIn Section I, the sentence starting with &#34;Because the interfaces supported...&#34; is not clear, please rephrase it.\r\n\r\nIn Section II, you should first explain the acronyms BC, RT and BM. You should then briefly present these three modes and better justify the choice of the RT mode. I do not understand the second paragraph, please rephrase it.\r\nPlease rephrase also The three last sentences of section II. I think that &#34;discontinuity&#34; is not the right term to use.\r\n\r\nIn Section III, in the second sentence what do you mean? Do you want to say that the number of remote terminals is higher than the number of any other device?\r\n\r\nIn Section III.C, you use &#34;low technology dependability&#34; as an advantage of your choice.High dependability is required.

It should be compliant with the standard.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nReview 2\r\nOverall evaluation: -2\r\n\r\nThe paper proposes a new design for an FPGA-based MIL-STD-1553B RT subsystem, which is a field-bus for military applications. The advantages over previous designs seem to be the reduced costs, and hence the scalability. The proposed design has also been implemented as a prototype to validate the correctness and to analyze the real behaviour of the implementation. It has been shown that the prototype implementation indeed complies with the MIL-STD-1553B standard.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not well versed in the area of real-time networks, which made is quite cumbersome to read the paper. This problem was further amplified by the writing style and the lack of explanations. For instance, the authors assume that each and every reader is fully aware of what MIL-STD-1553 actually stands for. That it refers to a field-bus standard is not explained in the abstract, or in the conclusions. Since the authors assume a much higher proficiency in their domain than I have, I am not able to judge the correctness and consistency of their approach. Since I am convinced that I will not be alone with this problem at the conference, I believe the paper should be rejected.\r\n\r\nYet, also just by the writing of the paper, I vote to reject it. To get this paper accepted, the authors have to\r\n- provide a much smoother introduction to their topic at a higher level. After all, it is a scientific conference, and low-level implementation details are not really interesting\r\n- completely avoid Figure such as 3,4,6. There is nothing to be learnt from Figure 3, little to be learnt from Figure 4, and Figure 6 is not readable. \r\n- improve the language. There are quite some strange grammatical constructions, which are not fully correct.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nReview 3\r\nOverall evaluation: -2\r\n\r\nThe paper is about implementation of a US military serial communication protocol using FPGA. The design adds also a CPU core to it.\r\nThe work is well written and structured.\r\n\r\nAbout content: The scientific contribution is not clearly stated. Authors present an implementation proposal using FPGA. Is your proposal wiling to overcome some difficulties about implementation challenges?\r\n\r\nWas the test bench created specifically for your development? Could you compare performance results among other running systems? What are the problems to overcome using your design proposal?\r\n\r\nIf you could change the direction of you work trying to answer those questions, then you are on the way of a scientific contribution.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nReview 4\r\nOverall evaluation: -2\r\n\r\nThere are several comments for this paper.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is quite unusual for a WiP. It is somewhat of a work in progress, but this is not the typical structure for documenting work in progress, but the paper follows the conventional discussion of achieved results.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the language is barely sufficient for understandability (it should be reviewed, there are several English errors) and contains several repetitions and vague statements.\r\n\r\nThe contributions seems marginal both in terms of novelty (an FPGA implementation of an MIL-STD-1553B controller) but especially in terms of design contributions. The system design is addressed only in its most simplistic way, no design challenges, options or issues are discussed, and the presented results consist only in electrical values as read by a logic analyzer.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion there is still a long way to go even for acceptance as WiP", "write_date": "2017-06-18T18:08:01Z", "update_date": "2017-06-19T10:55:26Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 128, "fields": {"subject": "Royyan - Response to Journal of Network and Computer Applications", "content": "blabla", "write_date": "2017-06-19T10:09:15Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.139", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 129, "fields": {"subject": "Royyan - Response to Journal of Network and Computer Applications", "content": "blablablabla", "write_date": "2017-06-19T10:10:22Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.139", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 130, "fields": {"subject": "Royyan - Response to Journal of Network and Computer Applications", "content": "Response to Journal of Network and Computer Applications", "write_date": "2017-06-19T10:14:38Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.139", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 131, "fields": {"subject": "Ha-yeon - ETFA 2017", "content": "Review 1\r\n\r\nOverall evaluation: 0\r\nThe paper presents a design of ship engine deflection detection system using a proximity sensor for smart device.

As a matter of fact only the 13 lines of the paragraph &#34;Shape Shifting Traffic Scheme&#34; at the end of the paper are aimed to describe the novelty proposed in this work. The content of [2] was summarized in a way that makes the paper hard to read, in the sense that there is not a seamless integration between the sections of the paper, and a number of concepts and symbols were not introduced.\r\nMoreover, a number of inaccuracies can be found, for instance when you describe Algorithm 1 you refer to (lines 2-6) and (lines 7-17) which are the lines of the algorithm as reported in [2]. In the plot of Fig. 4 the caption does not refer to the quantities reported in the plot.\r\n\r\nI think, it is important to introduce the concepts of QoS as reported in IEEE 802.11e, how reported results are obtained (simulation or real setup), and especially increase the space dedicated to the main argument of the paper (&#34;Shape Shifting Traffic Scheme&#34;), starting from the title.\r\n\r\n[2] L.

For this reason, the paper is difficult to read. \r\n\r\nThe paper could be better organised, for example Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2 can be removed, as they do not add any contributions to the paper. Instead, the paper lacks a better description of its main contribution, which is, currently, rather superficial.\r\n\r\nThe paper contribution is based on the IEEE 802.11 standard, which is not a recent standard, as mentioned in the paper. \r\n\r\nCaptions of Figures 4 and 5 are incorrect.\r\n\r\nReview 3:\r\n-2\r\nThe paper proposes rate adaption techniques over WLAn for video services in industries.\r\n\r\nThe main novelty of the paper is supposed to be Shape shifting algorithm , which is an enhancement to the existing work. \r\nHowever, the results shown in this paper are from an algorithm which has already been published. I would advise the conference chairs to not include this paper in the proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn order to accept this paper, following needs to be done in my opinion:\r\n\r\n1) Over view section should be shortened\r\n\r\n2) Figures 1 and 2 add nothing to the paper. Same goes for table 1. If the need to add figure 2 is strong, then it should be well motivated and the figure legends should be distinguishable even in Black and White\r\n\r\n3)Shape shifting algorithm must be explained in more detail, and outline the enhancements to your existing work. \r\n\r\n4) Existing work should not be a summary of the work done in this field. It should be used to compare and show what are the shortcomings of those works, and how is your work better.\r\n\r\n5) Some immediate results should be shown from the new algorithm (shape shifting in this case) and not from existing work.\r\n\r\n6) Explain please how figure 4 is obtained. If its from a simulation, then briefly describe simulation scenario. Similar elaboration will be required if the curves are obtained from hardware setup.\r\n\r\n7) Remove Figure 5 \r\n\r\n8) language of the paper, English tenses, grammar, everything needs to be reworked.

Furthermore, it is not clear whether the results (in particular those in Fig. 4) are statistically significant. The paper also needs proofreading, there are several odd sentences.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother comment: You should say right from the beginning that you consider multicast video. Without that information several statements in the introduction do not make sense (e.g. you say the transmitter does not know whether data is received correctly or not.

In this, it fails to deliver a convincing motivation and a comprehensible description of the algorithm. Furthermore, out of the 3.5 pages, ca. 1.5 pages are figures of marginal use to the reader. \r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nMajor issues:\r\nThe abstract claims to &#34;prove stability of IEEE 802.11ac ad- hoc network in the plants and point to point networks&#34; and that the paper will &#34;provide the optimal solution to various greenhouses&#34;. The paper, however, neither does contain any proof (or evaluation), nor does it define a notion of optimality regarding greenhouse connection performance. While a work-in-progress paper may not require an evaluation, claiming one that is not delivered is not acceptable.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nMajor issues:\r\nThe argument that plants could be in the way of the wireless communication path is a weak one: usually wifi can convey messages through concrete. Why are plants a problem that must be tackled? The paper is lacking any information of the brevity of the problem. If, as claimed, Korean farmers are mostly &#34;illiterates&#34;, not being able to use wireless sensor networks, why should they be able to use WiFi? This argument doesn&#39;t make sense either. Moreover, Table 1 and Fig. 2 appear to be irrelevant to the paper. Also, both are not explained in the text, but only their existence is referenced.\r\n\r\nMinor issues:\r\n- Many definitive and indefinite articles missing.\r\n- Please insert a blank between citations: &#34;802.11ac [5]&#34; is better readable than &#34;802.11ac[5]&#34; and do that consistently (cf. &#34;paper [3]&#34;.\r\n- Fig. 1 is too large for the conveyed information. \r\n- Sentence &#34;Tomatoes in the greenhouse&#34; is missing a verb.\r\n- The abbreviation WSN is not introduced.\r\n- What is an &#34;Intel Edison&#34; and why is it relevant (but not referenced)?\r\n\r\nPROPOSED SFNS\r\n\r\nMajor issues:\r\nThe paper does not explain how head nodes are elected, what the issues with multiple head nodes are, and how a node group is repaired to revert to having only a single head node. If this is not addressed, the network can diverge to consist of head nodes only. What is the effect of that? The example -- despite having the benefit of being illustrated using a sequence diagram -- is not explained comprehensibly:\r\n- the node groups [1/*] and [N-1/*] do not contribute to the example\r\n- which node becomes head node after disconnecting [N/3] is not explained\r\n- the textual description ends prior to the Greenhouse Administration System requesting data from node [N/3] (Fig. 5)\r\n\r\nMinor issues:\r\n- The abbreviation RSSI is not introduced.\r\n- Few definitive articles missing.\r\n\r\nIMPLEMENTATION\r\n\r\nMajor issues:\r\nFigure 6 is blurry, incomprehensible, and hence useless. The textual description of the application yielding &#34;listview control and slider controls to show data from sensors and to control actuators.&#34; does not help either.\r\n\r\nMinor issues:\r\n- Fig. 8 conveys basically the same information than Fig. 1, but depicts an antenna instead of the greenhouse: Why?\r\n\r\nOVERALL\r\n\r\nThe motivation in unclear as both claimed arguments are not supported by anything and the algorithm is not discussed properly as pointed out above. Hence, appreciating the contribution is complicated. Also, in the current form, this is not fit for publication.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nReviewer 3\r\nOverall evaluation: -2\r\nSummary\r\nThe authors describe a 802.11ac networked smart farm setup for collecting parameters of plants and controlling watering, ventilation, etc. For this purpose, they develop a test bed integrating some Intel Galileo boards and visualized the data at a web front-end.\r\n\r\nStrength\r\nSmart farming is an important topic. The adjustment of a suitable communication infrastructure in combination with a fault tolerant protocols is important for this large scale and highly dynamically scenarios. The topic meets the call of ETFA 2017.\r\n\r\nWeakness\r\nI did not find the specific contribution of the paper. The authors address greenhouse scenarios, but they miss to identify and to explain the specific conditions here. I don&#39;t think that plants in the line of sight effect the signal significantly. Here we need to know \r\n- which bandwidths have to be managed, \r\n- which level of jitter and delay can be tolerated or\r\n- how many nodes should be located in the scenario.\r\nBased on this technical analysis a well-founded selection of hard- and software is possible. This includes an evaluation of existing mesh protocols! \r\n\r\nAt the moment we just find some strange statements related to the capabilities of farmers. Where is the relation between the alliteration of a user and the chosen WSN or WLAN infrastructure?\r\nThe mentioned scenario addresses typical WSN domains and the decision for a WLAN setup is not convincing. \r\n\r\nThe language and grammar of the paper have to be revised carefully.", "write_date": "2017-06-19T10:54:55Z", "update_date": "2017-06-19T15:24:53Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 134, "fields": {"subject": "Hong-Keu  ETFA 2017", "content": "Review 4\r\nOverall evaluation: -1\r\n\r\n\r\nThis works proposes an approach to migrate virtualized systems running on an overloaded computing host to other hosts of a naval combat system.\r\nThe authors propose the use of live migration based on policies related to resource usage on both the virtual machines and the physical computers.\r\nFor that, the resource usage is classified under 6 types that, in turn, is used to select the most suitable match between the resources demand of the VM and the offered resources of the physical computer.\r\n\r\nAlthough the idea seems interesting, unfortunately, in this reviewer opinion, the text is a bit confusing on the novelty and the main expected contributions of this work.\r\n\r\nIn order to improve this short paper, it is important to make the text more clear and explicit on the following issues.\r\n\r\n1. It is important to describe clearly the research problem and the main motivation of this work.\r\nWhat is the difference of load balancing in a regular (and civil) cluster in comparison with a cluster of a naval combat system?\r\nAre there different and specialized computers and hardware or are they COTS components?\r\nIt would be worth to describe the usage scenarios, especially the engagement and non-engagement situations, in order to highlight why is the load balancing a critical issue in the target application.\r\n\r\n2. The description on the proposed selection schema is confusing.\r\nWhat is T policy? What is R policy?\r\nThe author must be more explicit that T policy is related to the A-F types presented in Fig 1 and R policy is related with the raking created once the VMs and host are classified in the A-F types.\r\nMoreover, the description of these policies and how they are applied need to be clarified.\r\nAuthors presented some formulas in section II.A, but the meaning of each formula and their terms is confusing. \r\nWhat do scl*vm terms mean? Do they mean the maximum capacity of VM or host resources?\r\nWhat do *vm terms mean? Do they mean the available resources or the resources usage?\r\nHow are these terms calculated? Does the system (VM or host) provide such info?\r\nWhy aren&#39;t there types in which two or three resources have the same amount (e.g. C and M are equal, or C, M and N are equal)?\r\nWhat are the criteria (or thresholds) to define the three value categories H, M and L?\r\nWhat does it mean the &#34;similarity&#34; and &#34;symmetry&#34; relations? Please be more explicit and detailed how have these relationships been defined.\r\nIn the first example, the authors claim that the VM are classified as a F type, and thus, the target host must be classified as a A type.\r\nWhy do not migrate such a VM to a B type host (the overloaded resource is CPU after all)?\r\nIt seems that the propose approach relates different kinds of resources (e.g. CPU and Network) in order to make the decision on the target host for migration.\r\nCPU and networking (or CPU and memory, or memory and networking) are resources of distinct nature and they server to different purposes.\r\nHow can they be combined in a coherent decision making process?\r\nIsn&#39;t processing (CPU) more important?\r\nThus, it is a bit confusing whether using such a combination will effectly provide the expected gains.\r\nAuthors are requested to detail and explain better why this is important and why it should be used rather than focusing on optimizing only one resource usage.\r\n\r\n3. There is no discussion on partial and preliminary results.\r\nIt would facilitate the reader understanding whether the preliminary results and their analysis can be presented.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nReview 2\r\nOverall evaluation: -2\r\n\r\n\r\nThis paper proposes some heuristics for migration of VMs to hosts for load balancing, when the load on multiple separate resource types is considered. The context is that of a a naval warship computer system, but it could be any system where VM migrations need to be managed both on the basis of current load and historical patterns of bursty high loads. The same heuristic is applied both for migration based on current load and for migration (called &#34;pre-migration&#34;) based on expected future resource use surge (as reflected in the past history of that VM). What is the heuristic?\r\n\r\nVMs and hosts are classified as being heavy, medium or light, in terms of usage, for each of the three resources and based on these combinations (e.g., HML, LLH, ...) they are categorised in types. The migration tries to match VMs and hosts of &#34;matching&#34; (complementary) types (called &#34;symmetric&#34; in the text). This is analogous to Tetris. (The comparison is meant illustratively and not disrespectfully.) The VMs and hosts of each type are also ranked in terms of absolute resource usage, so if one cannot match by type, the match is by rank.\r\n\r\nI think that it is an intuitive and meaningful heuristic, that is likely to work well. However, it is a bit too obvious, in my opinion. Moreover, the authors are somewhat vague in their descriptions (read detailed comments).\r\n\r\n\r\nDetailed comments, in order of appearance (including minor ones):\r\n\r\nIrregular -> irregular\r\n\r\nrisk of service provision -> risk in service provision\r\n\r\nmany existing studies proposes -> many existing studies propose\r\n\r\nthe host which have -> the host which has\r\n\r\nThere is a reference [4] in the text but at the end of the paper, the reference list has only 3 references! \r\n\r\nHowever, the probability -> However, if the probability\r\n\r\n\r\n&#34;In addition, first, these papers do not include ....&#34; You do not cite any papers to \r\n\r\njustify this statement.\r\n\r\nThere are many host and VM -> There are many hosts and VMs\r\n\r\nso each host and VM to exhibit -> so each host and VM tend to exhibit\r\n\r\nall of resources -> all of the resources\r\n\r\nof each nodes -> of each node\r\n\r\nthree resources information as ... -> information on three resources, namely ...\r\n\r\n&#34;Unlikely&#34;.

The authors provide four valid requirements for SDNs in RTEs and aim to solve the first requirement with an implementation and test, and propose a potential solution for the second requirement. But the presented solution strategies as well as their implementation and test are weak.\r\n\r\nThe first requirement is implemented as a &#34;delay module&#34; that aims to guarantee low delay and zero packet loss in a network. For this they &#34;only consider the first packet of a flow to determine the performance of delay module&#34;, i.e. they only send the first packet of a flow to the controller, evaluate it, and install all required flows rules at the switches that will be used to forward following packets. With this, they aim to reduce the latency of packet transmission by minimizing the controller interaction and its workload. It is unclear how this strategy could lead to a guaranteed zero packet loss especially because the authors don&#39;t describe a scenario where such packet loss could occur. The tests that were executed don&#39;t provide more information on this. They claim that their strategy leads to minimized delay and zero packet losses, and they also compare their idea to tests that were executed in a cited paper. But since details on the executed tests are not given by the!\r\nauthor, the results are not comparable and lack significance. Furthermore, the presented strategy can be seen as standard behavior of an SDN (It is also unclear how this strategy would even help to reduce packet loss in e.g. a situation where a link fails and the packet transmission must be switched to an alternative route. Also the packet delay is not only affected by the controller interaction but mainly by the utilization of the actual communication links). A valuable extension would have been to investigate the delay-influence of even this single controller interaction compared to a non-SDN or to handle the limited capacity of flow tables in switches that can probably not store flows that are created for each individual interaction between two entities.\r\n\r\nThe described scheduling module is more interesting and provides a time-triggered SDN flow approach. However, this is also weak since the implementation of such will most probably need special SDN switches that are aware of the different time slots and know when which flow is active. Details on a potential implementation, the expected problems and solution strategies, and especially on use cases and comparisons to existing time-triggered Ethernet protocols are missing at all and are referred to as future work. It would also be interesting to review how this solution compares e.g. to current standardization efforts in TSN and also a combination of the two domains (SDN and TSN).\r\n\r\nDue to this, the paper should not be accepted for presentation on the conference in this form. The implementation and test of the delay module is not very strong and shows large gaps. Furthermore the context of SDN, RTE, and its interconnection is not described well and also the motivation is unclear.\r\n\r\nFinally, the text should be grammatically revised (e.g. use OpenFlow instead of Openflow; use Ethernet instead of ethernet). Also, there are some errors in the formulas and in TABLE 1 (&#34;Set of time-triggered flows&#34; is named FS instead of TS). Additionally, there is an error in the author name of [1].

The paper proposes what are the requirements such a controller should fulfill and focuses on two of them: (1) guarateeing zero packet losses and (2) deadline fulfillment of Real Time Traffic. The paper proposes an algorithm for the controller to achieve (1) and provides some simulation results that seem to be promising. Also, the paper proposes an schedule schema for (2), even though it does not present any simulation or real test that demonstrates its Real Time guarantees.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Even though the paper is interesting, it has some important shortcomings regarding clearness and lack of justification for some important claims.\r\n\r\n- In particular the tests and results presented to demonstrate that the Authors proposal fulfills (1) are controversial. Similarly, no result or formal demonstration/argumentation is provided to support that Author’s proposal is going to fulfill (2). Therefore, in my opinion, Authors need to explicitly clarify that the results presented in this paper are preliminar.\r\n\r\n- Please, for more details on these shortcomings refer to the specific comments below.\r\n\r\n\r\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\nSpecific comments\r\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n\r\n\r\nI. INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n- What do authors specifically refer to as RTE networks? There are several proposals to make Ethernet adequate for real time industrial systems. Thus, it is necessary to clarify what specific RTE protocol or protocols are authors talking about and comparing their proposal to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Authors could provide some references about Openflow and further explain why it is more advantageous that other types of SDN controllers. In particular, why is Openflow more adequate for RTE industrial communications than other types of SDN controllers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. RELATED WORKS\r\n\r\n\r\n- It seems there is a contradiction between what is said at the beginning:\r\n\r\n“Application of SDN has been investigated definitively for industrial network application, as of by Henneke et al. [2] and Ka &#769;lma &#769;n [3]. (..) Du and Herlich [4] proposed an idea of integrating SDN for RTE. (..) Later in their next paper [1], they proved the concept by providing implementation setup on several network scenarios based on the requirement of SDN-enabled RTE.”\r\n\r\nand what is stated at the end of this Section:\r\n\r\n“All cited paper above works independently from those mentioned ideas (SDN for industrial network, software-defined RTE, and Openflow controller performance). (..)”\r\n\r\nPlease, may authors revise this last statement and rewrite it so as to prevent such a contraction? Otherwise, it is not possible to fully understand what is the advantage of the authors proposal compared to previous ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- 2nd paragraph, 2nd sentence. This sentence is hard to follow. May I ask authors to revise it to make it fully understandable?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Last sentence: “(..) the main contribution of this paper is to introduce a scheme for robust Openflow controller to be applied in software-defined RTE by SIMULATING the network on a VIRTUAL environment of RTE.” Until this point it seemed that authors proposed a first implementation based on a real, not virtual, RTE environment. Please, may I ask authors to make it clear from the very beginning (in the Abstract and Introduction) the kind of implementation/test they have conducted so far?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. SOFTWARE-DEFINED REAL-TIME ETHERNET\r\n\r\n\r\n- Please, may you consider the following comments of the list of requirements that are specified for the enhanced Openflow controller.\r\n\r\n- 1st requirement. There is an important typo here: “non-deterministic” should be “deterministic”.\r\n\r\n- 2nd requirement. The text is hard to follow/understand. What do authors want to actually state here?\r\n\r\n- 3rd requirement. It presents “admission control” as a mechanism to make the network secure, by identifying authorized and unauthorized packet flow. However, to my best knowledge, “admission control” rather refers to a set of mechanisms to provide the capacity of accepting/denying online changes in the traffic scheduling; based on either a given online schedulability analysis and/or an online policy to restrict who is authorized to request changes. Please, may I ask authors to consider also this alternative “meaning” of “admission control” or, at least, to mention and discuss a little bit about the necessity of “admission control” when it is understood from this alternative point of view?\r\n\r\n- 4th requirement. It refers to the necessity of recovery and retransmission mechanisms. However, it is not clear whether authors are interested in robustness, reliability, availability, etc. Please, may I ask authors to clarify what is/are the specific attribute/s of dependability they are interested in?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Last paragraph, 1st sentence just after the list of requirements. Authors claim: “This paper enhances THE existing Openflow controller”. To which specific realization/implementation of already existing Oplenflow controllers are they comparing their proposal?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Last paragraph, 3rd sentence. Authors say: “Hereafter, THE TWO PROPOSED requirements are referred to module name of delay module and scheduling module, and the definition of delay, latency, and jitter is considered equally as end-to-end delay transmission”. However, it is not clear to WHICH TWO proposed requirements are they talking about? Note that this ambiguity is also present in the first sentence of Section IV. Please, may I ask to clarify this ambiguity in both Sections?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. PROPOSED SCHEME\r\n\r\n\r\n- 1st paragraph. Authors say: “This paper mainly considers the first packet of a flow to determine the performance of delay module”. Why it is enough to consider just the 1st packet of a given flow? Moreover, why is the flow authors are going to consider relevant/representative for/of the delay measurement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Lower Delay and Zero Packet Losses Assurance\r\n\r\n\r\n- 1st paragraph. Authors explain that their proposal to guarantee zero packet losses is to minimize the controller workload so as to increase the chances or packets being successfully transmitted. This is a controversial claim. From my point of view, minimizing packet losses is not equivalent to guaranteeing zero packet losses. Therefore I would suggest authors to clarify this issue from the very beginning, since one of the contributions of the paper is claimed to be that NO packet will be lost!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Algorithm specified by pseudocode and its explanation. Both, the pseudocode and its explanation can be improved in terms of clarity; some parts of the explanation are hard to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Transmission Process Scheduling\r\n\r\n\r\n- Table 1. This table and the part of the main text that references this table uses two different acronyms to referring to the “set of time-triggered flows”: FS and TS.\r\n\r\n\r\n- 2nd paragraph, 2nd sentence. This sentence is hard to follow and may be sintactically incorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\n- List of constraints, 2nd item, expressions. These expressions and its explanation should be improved. It is necessary to clarify what does it mean that “The source host has maximum one outgoing links and no incoming links” and that “the destination host has maximum one incoming links with no outgoing links”. Do they mean that a host can only act as a sender or only as a receiver, but cannot act as sender and receiver? Moreover, on the one hand, please define what “in(src(i))”, “out(dst(i))” mean. On the other hand, there is a syntactic error in the second term: “V|src(i),dst(i)}”.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Last paragraph. Here it is claimed that the formulations given in this subsubsection maximizes the number of flows that are schedulable from a given set of flows. Nevertheless, this claim needs to be substantiated by means of further discussion. Otherwise, it is controversial; authors should demonstrate this claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. ANALYSIS AND FUTURE DIRECTION\r\n\r\n\r\n- 1st paragraph. It eventually states: “Moreover, installing some proactive flow entries based on other real-time requirements mentioned in the proof- of-concept of software-defined RTE by Herlich et al. [1] can help to MAXIMIZE THE RESULT”. To WHICH RESULT does this statement refer to? What does it mean to MAXIMIZE?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- The section does not make it clear neither what is the topology of the network nor the conditions of the setup used by other authors to evaluate the number of packet losses with the software-defined RTE by Herlich et al. and RSTP (reference [1]). Were these two alternatives evaluated in [1] using the same topology and traffic as for the authors proposal?\r\n\r\nThe same doubts arise concerning the evaluation of the controller overhead carried out for JumpFlow in [5]. Certainly, authors explain that JumpFlow was not designed for industrial networks and RTE, but then, what is the point of comparing their proposal with JumpFlow?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Figure 1. Please, describe a bit further what the blue lines mean in this figure. In particular, what is the percentage of each measured number of packet losses for RTSP? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Last but one paragraph. It is not clear why or how the proposed scheduling schema does suit for DSN RTE. Authors explain the basic ideas of this schema, but they do not demonstrate its suitability.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------- REVIEW 3 ---------------------\r\nPAPER: 260\r\nTITLE: A Robust Openflow Controller for Software-defined Real-time Ethernet\r\nAUTHORS: Alif Akbar Pranata, Tae Soo Jun and Dong-Seong Kim\r\n\r\nOverall evaluation: -1 (weak reject)\r\n\r\n----------- Overall evaluation -----------\r\nA robust flow controller for software-defined ethernet is described.

Obviously it results in the expected result of Figure 2 (no need to do any implementation of measurement to get the same conclusion!).\r\nThe scheduling optimization seems do not consider the multicast cases. In addition it is not applied to a numerical case.\r\n\r\nThe paper deals with a very interesting and important topic. However, the contribution is still too small, even for a WiP.

The article is nicely written and do not contain many typos. However, this reviewer has some concerns about the article that needs to be clarified before it can be considered for acceptance into TII.\r\n\r\n1) The title say Energy-aware real-time routing.... but this reviewer wonder where the real-time come into play in this paper and it seems it is not included in the optimization formulation? Moreover, the authors use the metric average end-to-end delay in their work. If you speaking in terms of real-time and industrial control application the metric average end-to-end delay is useless - it should be the worst-case delay! Average end-to-end delay is used in best-effort systems.\r\n\r\n2) Regarding the simulation set-up it would be interesting to know how often packets are sent from each device since that has a huge impact on the simulations. Furthermore, has the authors used any kind of channel model and if so, what kind of model is used? This reviewer is also questioning the scenario used in the simulations. Is it actually realistic to assume 50 gateways? Most IWSNs deployed today are centralized, meaning one gateway serving X sensors/actuators.\r\n\r\n3) I think the article would deserve from reducing the number of references and put focus on the routing scheme, results and maybe try to make a real implementation. However, this reviewer think it would be interesting for the authors too maybe compare your performance to the optimization formulation presented in the TII articles End-to-end reliability-aware scheduling for WSNs and in QoS-aware cross-layer configuration for IWSN.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nIn this article, the authors propose a routing scheme that enhances energy consumption and end-to-end delay for large-scale networks.\r\n\r\nEven though the begin their motivation for selecting IEEE 802.15.4 with M. Palattella’s article, however they do not convince me why they chose IEEE 802.15.4a instead of IEEE 802.15.4e (now IEEE 802.15.4-2016), and more specifically, i.e., IEEE 802.15.4-2016 TSCH mode.\r\n\r\nI have the impression that the authors misunderstood TDMA with TSCH, “we employed a hierarchical framework consisting of three types of elements: I/O devices, routers, and gateways while an IEEE 802.15.4a carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme is used as the MAC protocol. Instead of time division multiple access (TDMA), the IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA protocol could support for satisfying either the power savings or the latency requirement in the IIoT system.”, see at the end of the page 1, second column.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, IEEE 802.15.4-TSCH is not pure TDMA! TSCH stands for Time-Synchronized Channel Hoping, thus, TDMA + Channel hopping.\r\nThen, TSCH was proposed so that the standard to be ultra low-power, low-latency (i.e., deterministic traffic) and highly reliable (i.e., above 99.999%). Thus, claiming that the authors chose IEEE 802.15.4a to satisfy the low-power and latency operation does not stand!\r\n\r\nAiming for Industrial Wireless Networks, the authors could employ the whole stack (or at least some of the RFCs) that is proposed by the IETF. For instance, reinventing the wheel, RPL, the leading routing protocol for industrial networks, should the basis to extend the potential solution in order to be layer independent.\r\n\r\nNext, Section III C, it is not clear to me why the authors chose to heavily rely their contribution on an existing algorithm for energy efficiency purposes. As a result, I do not see any innovation on Subsection III C!\r\n\r\nRegarding the performance evaluation campaign, I am not satisfied at all for the employed tools.\r\nUsing Matlab and OPNET Modeler, while the authors target “Industrial-based” applications, sounds contradictory, when there are number of freely available tools to perform the validation, i.e., Contiki OS, OpenWSN, Tiny OS, RIOT, etc. Moreover, the authors could at least employ the 6TiSCH IoT stack for their evaluation.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, the size of the article is very short! To be more precise, the authors finished they contribution at 6 and half pages, while they dedicated more than one page for references, isn’t it that much for 8-pages article ??? I would expect something between 18-22 references.\r\n\r\nFinally, the paper have set of typos here and there, thus, it will need definitely a good proof-reading.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe authors consider an hierarchical large-scale network. In the first tier there are devices which form clusters. In the second tier there are router that operate as cluster heads for the end devices and route traffic to the third tier, i.e. gateways. In this context, the authors propose an hierarchical routing algorithm that aims to primarily minimise energy consumption, and secondarily end-to-end delay. The authors evaluate their proposed algorithm in OPNET simulations, where the algorithm outperforms 3 other routing schemes in all domains.\r\n\r\nThe key contributions of the paper can identified in two parts of the routing scheme: the cluster head selection and the routing scheme between the router nodes. Both schemes utilise two sources of information to form the paths: the geometrical distance between nodes and the residual energy of the nodes. Given a plethora of works for energy-aware routing, the novelty of the proposed scheme is not very clear. I would suggest the authors to enumerate the key elements that make their work unique.\r\n\r\nThe authors should also provide more intuition on how the cluster head selection algorithm works. According to the scheme, the cluster head that maximised Eq. (8) is selected as the cluster head. There are two issues with Eq. (8).\r\n- The E_{s-res_k} seems to be irrelevant, as it does not depend on the candidate cluster head r_j. In other words it contributes equal to all candidates.\r\n- The denominator includes the average residual energy of the members of the candidate cluster.  In other words, the higher the residual energy of the members of the cluster, the more likely to be selected. This is decision needs to be further justified: it is not clear how the residual energy of the cluster members affect the energy consumption of s_k or r_j.\r\n\r\nIt must be also highlighted that algorithm uses as input the geometrical distance of two nodes. This is fairly difficult to obtain: it perhaps can be estimated through the received signal strength but this estimation would be quite erroneous in realistic environments. Why the authors do not use the expected transmission count (ETX) instead? ETX is a very standard routing metric, as it incorporates the dependence of distance on link quality, the energy consumed for retransmissions and the delay caused by retransmissions.\r\n\r\nLastly, the authors should further justify Eq. (1).  This function calculates the energy consumed for transmission as a function of the distance. This fails to capture the maximum radiation limits, as well as the fact that practical radios offer certain finite levels of transmission power settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 4\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nHonestly, I think the main topic of the article does not fit into this journal. I would recommend authors to send the article to other journals more specialized in the networking topic:\r\n* IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications\r\n* Elsevier Communication Networks\r\n* Elsevier Ad Hoc Networks\r\n* ...\r\nOr even some journal with a more general character:\r\n* IEEE Internet of Things Journal\r\n* ...\r\n\r\nReviewer: 5\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper presents some preliminary research on energy aware and real time routing scheme for IIOT. However, the paper is not immune from major flaws.\r\n\r\n+ the manuscript is not well prepared, a professional proof reading is required to further improve paper quality to meet TII’s basic requirement for publication. Parts of the manuscript should be re-written, the meaning conveyed was either vague or hindering the reviewer’s understanding of the content itself. For instance, P1. L53 “the number of previous works deeply investigating solutions for developing the IIoT has been insignificant while the authors only focused on improving the IoT technology.” The num. of previous works was “insignificant” or “insufficient”? The authors state that previous works focused only on “improving IoT tech”, where the criticism is vague, and needs further clarification. Similar problems can be found in other parts of the paper, e.g. P2. L54, “In the first stage.. . Next, in the second stage”; P2. L8 sentence “.. characteristic of wireless communication” should end up with a Period. P2. L10 “Firstly, thanks to ….. Finally”, and so on.

TDMA schemes are more efficient for multiple users. Even more, how is the bandwidth shared among transmitters (unequal bandwidth assigned to each)? How does each node now its allocated bandwidth? This requires some kind of management/control mechanism.\r\n- The simulation results are based on pre-assigned length of duty cycles. In a deployed network these parameters should be measured. Besides, from paragraph above Section V, it should be explained how the environment condition (pn) can be used to avoid collisions. If it is an average value, nothing is known of its instantaneous value.\r\n- The theoretical problem is stated, but the solution is not explained, only a likely procedure is briefly indicated.\r\n- Some clarifications would be required for figure 2:\r\n- If end-to-end delay is linear with the number of hops (equation 9), the line in figure 2.c for EFDA should linearly increase with the number of hops. It can&#39;t remain constant.\r\n- Does Figure 2.b take into consideration the transmission of beacons, and the transmission at different hops? How are these 5000 bits split between transmitters?

Also, it is not clear the weighting factor role in the improvement of the proposed scheme in comparison to the basic method. \r\nAlso, some parts of the manuscript including Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2, equations 1, 5, and 6, and Figure 1 are copied from ref [14]. \r\nMoreover, in Section 3 the authors did describe their scheme but did not well discuss/prove the efficiency & novelty of that approach. The motivation and the methodology used is not clearly justified. The authors failed to address some scientific reasons. For example, place of SNR level is ambiguous in the proposed scheme. Where is applied? Which formula? \r\nThe BCH and CRC codes are error control techniques that are able to detect or correct the occurred error in the transmission media. These methods are based on the adding information redundancy to the transmitted packets and the receiver can do the error checking by analysis of these redundancy bits. These methods work correctly if and only if the both transmitter and receiver are not faulty. Therefore, how the proposed scheme can distinguish between transmission error and fault transmitter? \r\nIn addition, the simulation and theoretical analysis is not strong in this paper and leaves open a number of questions such as \r\n1.    Unfortunately, there is no information about the simulation experiments such as simulation tool/tools and simulation parameters in this manuscript. \r\n2.    Also, the proposed algorithm performances didn&#39;t compare to other algorithms. Therefore, I cannot judge the effectiveness of the simulation results. \r\n3.    There is not guidance for Figure 4(b). \r\n4.    Most of the horizontal and vertical axes of the charts are lack of unit. \r\n5.    There is not description about ‘Rho’ [Figure 4(a)] in this manuscript. \r\n6.    There is no discussion about how the misdetection rate is calculated. \r\n7.    It is not specified the parameter of the horizontal axis of figure 2. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I think the paper needs to be revised and a major revision needs to be done on this paper before publication. Overall, contributions are unclear and weak.

I like the idea of competitive Lotka-Volterra (C-LV) model to avoid congestion and further apply Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) over C-LV to show fairness.\r\n\r\nI believe the paper has potential to be published after some specific modifications, as mentioned below:\r\n\r\n(1) The author introduced C-LV. But, there is no competitive analysis of C-LV shown. How much competitive is it?\r\n\r\n(2) The PSO is a optimization tool. But there is no analysis showing how much close to optimal solution could the authors obtain? Generally these algorithm do not provide global optimal solution, but some near-optimal solution. Then how much close to global optimality could be achieved?\r\n\r\n(3) Simulation results are good, but lack any comparison with existing results. Equation(3) ~ Equation(6) do not say anything about it.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper addresses the congestion control and the dynamic rate control in wireless sensor networks.\r\n\r\nThe problem is faced through an hybrid approach that uses two well-known algorithms, that are L-CV and PSO. The literature widely discusses these algorithms and many works already presents the same analytical models reported in Section II and Section III.\r\n\r\nSimulations were conducted though ns-3. But, a simple and single-hop network based on the IEEE 802.11 (i.e., WiFi) is taken into account. WSNs, instead, use different MAC protocols, different physical settings and transmission rates, as well as different topologies (including multi-hop).\r\n\r\nFigure 5 reports the most important results. Many works in the literature that uses L-CV and PSO in WSN report similar curves. Thus, it is not clear the novelty level of the submitted manuscript.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nA hybrid bio-inspired algorithm was proposed for congestion control in large-scale WSNs in this paper. First, the C-LV model-based scheme is applied to avoid congestion in WSNs and to maintain fairness among sensor nodes. In addition, the PSO algorithm is applied to enhances the C-LV scheme by optimizing the parameter for minimizing end-to-end delay and to help the system adapt to changes in the number of sensor nodes. This paper is somehow interesting, detailed comments:\r\n1. The complexity of the proposed method is not very clear, which shouldbe discussed.\r\n2. The proposed method should be compared to the existing works to demonstrate the novelty of this paper, for example, this paper can compare to the following works in introduction or simulation results:\r\n&#34;Aggressive Congestion Control Mechanism for Space Systems,&#34; IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, vol. 31, no. 3, pp. 28-33, June 2016.\r\n3. The writing of this paper should be polished.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nReviewer: 4\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper presents a Bio-inspired algorithm that could be used to optimize the fairness of resources for wireless sensor networks. The algorithm is based on a combination of Lotka-voltera competition algorithm, as well as particle swarm optimization. Since the Lotka Voltera has parameters that reflects on the rate of resource consumption, determining this parameter is highly dependent on the scenario (e.g size of the species, number of species, etc.). In order to determine the optimum level for this, the authors used the PSO algorithm. The simulation was evaluated on a star topology.\r\n\r\nThe work is interesting, and there has been many works in the past that has looked at applying LV algorithms for managing resources in computer networks, which the authors has avoided to reference. This work gives an added flavour of using PSO on top to determine the optimal parameters. However, there was a number of disappointing aspects to this paper. Firstly, the authors should have done a comparison of just pure LV that does not have an optimum value of the parameter, and compare two extremes (when one species is highly competitive, compared to an even competition amongst all) - so in other words static parameters. Then we can see how the optimum value fairs against these two extreme cases. Secondly, it would have been nice if the authors also did tests for other random topologies (just one random topology would be sufficient), which already had predefined paths, and competition was conducted on these paths. This would be very interesting, and a nice contribution, because as the rate of transmission between different nodes changes, there are chances that the resource consumption that overlaps between paths will lead to dynamic changes of the parameters that is only a segment of that path (rather than the entire path). This would definitely make the paper more interesting, and will add value to the need for the algorithms. One thing I am also confused with, is that in the star topology, the nodes all send packets straight to a sink. Does that mean the competition is for the resources at the sink itself, because there want be any competition along each path? It would be good why the authors also only had 10 as a maximum particle search bound for the particles in the PSO. If they authors could fix all these issues, this would be a strong paper and should be considered for publication.", "write_date": "2018-02-19T13:30:29Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "192.168.208.123", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 148, "fields": {"subject": "[Domestic Journal]권용현, 차중혁, 김동성, &#34;비대칭 다중접속기법 기반의 전술 무선 망 설계 및 성능분석&#34;", "content": "Reviewer 1, 2 : Accept\r\nReviewer 3 : After edit, review again (Summary)\r\n (1) Readability and write more detail contents.\r\n (2) Not suitable part of simulation comparison.", "write_date": "2018-02-27T15:31:24Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.136", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 149, "fields": {"subject": "Hoa Tran-Dang, Dongg-Seong Kim: &#34;Efficient Bandwidth-Aware Routing for Underwater Cognitive Acoustic Sensor Networks&#34;, IET Journal of Wireless Sensor System, IF: 1.34", "content": "Dear Prof. Kim\r\n\r\nWSS-2017-0166\r\n\r\nEfficient Bandwidth-Aware Routing for Underwater Cognitive Acoustic Sensor Networks\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting your paper to IET Wireless Sensor Systems.

The topic is very interesting. However, the reviewer has several comments on this work.\r\n\r\n1) The proposed scheme is based on the update of neighbor tables frequently (what is the exact frequency? what is the “frequency” concerned with?), yet what is the cost of this action (including the energy consumption and processing time)? Since in the underwater acoustic (UWA) environment, it is not easy to do the update so frequently due to the limited energy supply and long time transmission delay. The authors should evaluate the balance of the benefit and the cost.\r\n\r\nAlso in section 3.2.1, what is the time cost of initialization? The UWA channels may change after long waiting.\r\n\r\n2) The authors should add some references about the work of relay selection when existing both RR and CR are in the terrestrial radio channels. And point out that why it could apply to UWA channels. Also, more research paper could be cited about cooperative communications in UWA channels, especially from journals such as JOE and JASA. Here are some examples:\r\n[A] S. Al-Dharrab, et al. “Cooperative Underwater Acoustic Communications,” IEEE Communications Magazine, vol. 51, no. 7, pp. 146-153, Jul. 2013\r\n[B] Y. Chen, et al, “FDM modulated dynamic coded cooperation in underwater acoustic channels,” IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering, vol. 40, no. 1, pp. 159-68, Jan. 2015.\r\n[C] Y. Zhang, et al, “Dynamic Node Cooperation in an Underwater Data Collection Network,” IEEE Sensors Journal, vol. 16, no. 11, pp. 4127-4136, Jun. 2016\r\n[D] PC Sofotasios, et al, “Relay Selection Based Full-Duplex Cooperative Systems under Adaptive Transmission,”IEEE Wireless Communications Letters, 2017 , PP (99) :1-1\r\n\r\n3) The authors said Eq. 2 is valid for 100 Hz<f<3 kHz. However, the frequency is 30 kHz during the simulation in section 4.1. Why?\r\n\r\nFrom Eq. 1, the transmission loss is related to the transmission distance, and the ambient noise is related to the frequency from Eq.7. Then the SNR is only related to the distance from Eq.8 once the frequency is fixed at 30 kHz. Hence, both ToA(i&#61664;s) and SNR(i&#61664;s) are only related to the distance. In this case, it seems that it only considers the distance for each hop transmission and it can not reflect the difference between ToA and SNR in Table 2.\r\n\r\n4) During the simulation, it is better to present the performances (average end-to-end delay, energy consumption, etc.) vs. the number of relays (fix the source-to-destination distance).\r\n\r\n5) How to define the packet delivery ration in Fig. 6 and how to calculate the energy consumption in Fig. 7? The authors should present the formulas.\r\n\r\n6) The authors should pay more attention to the writing, such as:\r\n---In Eq. 8, B(r,f) should be B_T(r,f) as mentioned in Eq. 1.\r\n---In the end of section 3.2.3, the authors said “Since GPS or localization information of nodes are considered in this paper”; however, in the conclusion part, the authors said “Thus, our method can be easily implemented…without requiring additional hardware components, i.e., GPS.”\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nIn this paper, the authors considered the routing design for underwater acoustic sensor networks. With the consideration of the poor acoustic link quality,they did a cross-layer design of physical layer and network layer, where when a routing relay node was selected, a cooperative relay node was also chosen for each hop. However, details of the implementation of this design were not described, such as how to design the time slot length for the cooperation. and performance evaluation for this design is not enough. And the conclusion that this proposed routing algorithm  could improve the performance of UASNs with regard to average end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio and energy consumption should be carefully derived. What was your cost of your proposed design?\r\n  Moreover, some descriptions should be checked. The authors mentioned that the this formula for attenuation approximation in (2) was valid for 100Hz < f < 3kHz, while in the simulation setup, the sensor nodes all operated at 30kHz.", "write_date": "2018-02-27T21:59:14Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "192.168.208.103", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 151, "fields": {"subject": "Hoa Tran-Dang, Dongg-Seong Kim: &#34;Energy-Efficient Cooperative Routing in Underwater Cognitive Acoustic Sensor Networks&#34;, IEICE Communication Express, IF: 1.34", "content": "[Notification of Rejection] \r\n\r\nFebruary 22, 2018. \r\n\r\nManuscript ID: 2018XBL0016 \r\nPaper/Letter: Letter \r\nIssue: XB \r\nRegular/Special: Regular \r\nTitle of Special Section: \r\nTitle: Energy-Efficient Cooperative Routing in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks \r\nDate of Evaluation: February 21, 2018. \r\n\r\n=============== \r\n!!

Consequently, this letter investigates selection of a relay node \r\nconsidering cooperative communication rather than combining routing and \r\ncooperative communication. \r\n\r\n2. There are a lot of work about cooperative communications in wireless sensor \r\nnetworks. For example, the following paper investigates the energy-efficient \r\ncooperative communication, like this letter. In the system model, the reviewer \r\ncannot find the difference between wireless sensor networks and UW-ASNs. \r\nTherefore, the past work in wireless sensor networks can be applied to the \r\nsystem model in this letter, and the novelty of this letter is unclear. \r\n\r\n[A] Z. Zhou, S. Zhou, J.H. Cui, and S. Cui, &#34;Energy-efficient cooperative \r\ncommunication based on power control and selective single-relay in wireless \r\nsensor networks,&#34; IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun., vol.7, no.8, pp.3066-3078, \r\nAug. 2008. \r\n\r\nOther comments: \r\n\r\n3. Cooperative routing described in 2.2.2 selects a next-hop node and a relay \r\nnode. In this system, not only i but also j is a parameter of f2 in (5) and f3 in \r\n(11). At the line 1 in algorithms 2 and 3, &#34;for i in NB(s,d)&#34; should be &#34;for i,j in \r\nNB(s,d)&#34;. At the line 4, &#34;relay <- NB(s,d)\\{i}&#34; should be &#34;relay <- j&#34;. \r\n\r\n4. At l.15, p. 3, &#34;b is the bandwidth&#34; should be &#34;B is the bandwidth&#34;. \r\n\r\n5. In the simulation results, the authors depict figures of minimum transmission \r\nenergy for each sample. From these figures, it is slightly difficult to find the \r\nperformance difference among routing algorithms. The authors had better show \r\nstatistical values of simulation results, for example, the cumulative density \r\nfunction of the minimum transmission energy of the routing algorithms. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are re-submitting a manuscript revised from this rejected one in IEICE Transactions, you are kindly encouraged to attach an &#34;Authors&#39; Reply&#34; to the revised manuscript in order to expedite the review process. \r\n\r\nPlease note that even re-submission should be done from the following \r\nURL https://review.ieice.org/regist/regist_baseinfo_e.aspx like an initial submission and send the required documents to IEICE again.", "write_date": "2018-02-27T22:02:05Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "192.168.208.103", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 152, "fields": {"subject": "Alif - Computer Standards and Interfaces", "content": "Ref: CSI_2017_338\r\nTitle: Overhead Reduction Scheme for SDN-based Data Center Networks\r\nJournal: Computer Standards & Interfaces\r\nDear Professor Kim,\r\nThank you for submitting your manuscript to Computer Standards & Interfaces.

Their main idea is that the SDN architecture model for DCNs is based on the flow-level rather than the packet-level, however, this idea is not new, and may be one of the versions of OpenFlow specification they may provide either packet- or flow-level service. They didn&#39;t mention which version of OF specification is used in their implementation. Therefore, the authors should provide more detailed information about using OF specification and what is a novelty of the ideas in the paper clearly.\r\n\r\n-Reviewer 2\r\n\r\n  - Please compare your proposed method with similar methods (Not only the original !)\r\nThere are many new methods have been proposed in the last 1.5 years but are not included in the related works.\r\n\r\n-Reviewer 3\r\n\r\n  - This paper proposes some methods for reducing the controller workload and the switch flow table size. \r\nOnly the first packet sent to the controller. But will it bring a trouble on synchronization at the next switches among the following packets before the rules updated? To reduce the overhead on the switch by source routing, this idea is similar to some previous work such as JumpFlow.\r\n\r\n-Reviewer 4\r\n\r\n  - This paper proposed a framework on controller and switches to reduce overhead for SDN-based Data Center Networks. The proposed method can boost network performance by reducing the number of PACKET IN and PACKET OUT messages, higher throughput, and lower end-to-end latency.\r\nThis paper is appropriate for the journal, and well-organized. Simulation seems to be done considering details. I could find several English grammar errors which are expected to be corrected.\r\n\r\n-Reviewer 5\r\n\r\n  -\r\nThis paper considers the scalabilty issues in SDN. Two mechanisms have been proposed to reduce the message overhead between controllers and switches. The first mechanism is to reduce the number of packet-in messages by processing only the first packet of a flow in the controller. The second mechanism is to reduce the rule installation by using a MPLS-like mechanism.\r\nThis paper is lack of novelty. For the first mechanism, in fact, most current SDN applications handles packet-in messages just like this! That is, in reactive mode, when a SDN application receives a packet-in message, it calculates forwarding rules, and install rules in the sending switch and other switches in the forwarding path to setup the flow path. Thus, I cannot see any novelty in the first mechanism. \r\nThe second mechanism considers how to install minimal flow rules in the case where the packet traverses a long forwarding path. As the author said, it is motivated by [15]. However, [15] has contained the solutions for the scenario that this paper considers, as it is said that “Owing to the hop limit, a packet’s complete routing information must be divided into several sections and loaded at different switches on its forwarding route” in [15]. Thus, there is no novelty in this paper.\r\nSome detailed comments:\r\n1. The introduction section should be rephrased. The content is not concise and introduce many things about the background which should be put in Section 3.\r\n2. I don’t realize the meaning of section 2.1, I think it should be deleted, for it has nothing to do with your two research aspects.\r\n3. The size of topologies in the evaluation is small and I don’t think the results are convicing.\r\n4. Why the traffic rate is set to 10,000 packets/s? I think more experiments should be conducted with different traffic rate.\r\n5. I suggest there should be a paragraph that introduce the content of the whole section at the beginning of each section to make the paper more clear.\r\n6. This sentence is not clear,&#34;This paper proposes a framework on controller and switches to reduce overhead for SDN-based Data Center Networks (DCNs)&#34;, reduce what overhead?\r\n7. &#34;Generally, they are inflexible and do not effectively utilize available resources, including CPUs, memory, and storage to run today’s network activities&#34;, what do they refer to? It’s hard to understand.\r\n8.&#34;and this first part is reduces the number of PACKET IN message” -> is to reduce…\r\n9. &#34;To enhance performance, many support techniques to reduce lack of flexibility, scalability, and efficiency have been proposed,&#34; This sentence should be rephrased.\r\n10. &#34;This paper discusses the requirements for reducing controller and switch overhead in SDN-based DCN as follows:&#34; This sentence should be rephrased.\r\n11. &#34;the algorithm allocates i as 1 to be the counter of switch set S involved in the flow forwarding path.&#34; This sentence is confusing.\r\n12.

There are too many irrelevant descriptions in the manuscript. Readers can be referred to appropriate literature where necessary and the entire text should be pruned down. \r\n2. The authors should state in quantitative terms, and also relate it clearly to their problem statement, the implications of current large wiring systems in aircraft systems. \r\n3. Why did the authors concentrate on the wings alone? \r\n4. Was network failure anticipated? In that case, what would be an alternative? Authors should provide explanation on the above questions. \r\n5. The Problem Statement section is too long and monotonous. This should be made precise, stating clearly what the problems are, and why proffering solutions would be necessary. \r\n6. The literature review of the study should be revisited. Authors should extract the research gaps from the existing literature and articulate how the current efforts attempt to close the gaps. Discussions should also caption comparison of the currents results with previous efforts. \r\n7. Detail description of S-V model is not necessary. The description should be very concise. Readers should be referred to the mother paper and related references. \r\n8. The implementation time should be discussed. The authors need to stress the practical implications of their results. \r\n9.

The secret data is embedded into the phase information of FFT coefficients, using Rounding Reduced-Arc M-ary Phase Shift Keying (MPSK) modulation. \r\n\r\nThe main achievement of the proposed method is high capacity, even more than 21 kilobits per second. Apart from high capacity, the proposed solution also provides a high level of imperceptibility. However, the embedded information cannot be recovered with 100% fidelity even in the absence of attacks. This is a very serious shortcoming of the proposed solution. \r\n\r\nI am afraid that the manuscript cannot be accepted due to the mentioned shortcoming. In addition, there are other major comments wrt the proposed solution that should be addressed by the authors in their future work: \r\n\r\n1. The authors mention that the values of $\\alpha$ and $n$ are coupled. The exact relationship between those parameters should be provided explicitly in the manuscript. \r\n\r\n2. There are absolutely no details about the genetic algorithm and the parameters used for optimising the fitness function. \r\n\r\n3. The fitness function is not explained. The contribution of BER in the fitness function is somewhat surprising. Larger BER values seem to prove a better fitness than smaller values. For example, 0.3 BER would provide better fitness than 0.1 BER. This does not appear to be reasonable. \r\n\r\n4. The advantages (if any) of the proposed method wrt that of reference [5]: \r\n\r\nJose Juan Garcia-Hernandez, Ramon Parra-Michel, Claudia Feregrino-Uribe, Rene Cumplido, High payload data-hiding in audio signals based on a modified OFDM approach, Expert Systems with Applications, Volume 40, Issue 8, 2013, Pages 3055-3064. \r\n\r\nare unknown. In fact, the proposed method is not compared with any other audio data hiding scheme. \r\n\r\n5. Robustness is not discussed. It seems that the proposed scheme is fragile against attacks. If so, it would be useful for steganography, but there are many steganographic methods for audio with payloads much higher that 20 kbps. Hence, what would be the advantage of the proposed solution compared to audio steganography that provides much more capacity? The answer should be statistical undetectability, but such an analysis is not carried out in the manuscript. \r\n\r\nFinally there are some minor comments: \r\n\r\n- In general, figures are too small to be read (in some cases even with zoom). \r\n\r\n- In equation (8), $S’_j$ is repeated. \r\n\r\nAdditional Questions: \r\n1.

The proposed embedding system is trivial, in that some very well known strategies to improve the robustness of audio watermarking are completely ignored as for example channel encoding and spread spectrum. Moreover, strategies to improve the inaudibility of audio watermarking exploiting psycho-acoustic models, are not considered at all. On the other hand, the proposed scheme is tested without considering classical type of attacks, e.g., compression, analogue palyback, white noise, etc., and hence it is impossible to evaluate the performance comparing them with those of alternatives. As a matter of fact, the references are not adequate, and they do not consider lot of papers that have treated the same issue or that are relevant for this topic: \r\n\r\n1.\tHafiz M. A.

As an example, it is not clear in equation (3) where the information is, in that the new symbol is equal to the previous one plus a phase shift Ps that, according to Fig. 1 is a constant term. If this is the case the Symbol j has zero entropy since it is equal to the previous one plus a constant term, and hence no information is embedded. In general embedding and extraction processes are not clearly presented, it is not clear if they consider a differential MPSK or not. Moreover it is not clear why they use a limited Arc to embed signals, no rationale for this choice is given. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions: \r\n1.

Rate the references: Unsatisfactory (explain): \r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3 \r\n\r\nRecommendation: R - Reject (Paper Is Not Of Sufficient Quality Or Novelty To Be Published In This Transactions) \r\n\r\nComments: \r\nReview of the paper: “High-Capacity and Transparent Digital Data-Hiding using Rounding Reduced-Arc MPSK”. \r\nThis paper deals with a data hiding technique for embedding information in audio signals. The data is aggregated as PSK symbols in the phase domain at certain frequency components of the audio signal. In addition, a genetic algorithm is employed for identifying the best values for some of the parameters of the method. Although the paper is more or less understandable, I cannot support the current publication of it due to the following reasons: \r\n1.- The introduced novelty is misleading and not sufficient: The proposed technique is clearly based on the proposal in [5], but the paper claimed that in this work is where the rounding of reduced arc M-ary shift keying is proposed, which is not fair, as it is precisely the contribution of [5]. Furthermore, at the beginning of section II it is said that: “…[5] who had attempted to apply…”, which is misleading, as in [5] the proposal was not only attempted, but succeeded. \r\nFrom my revision, I understand that the difference between the proposed technique and the one in [5] was the treating of the embedded signal, by means of (3), as a differential PSK modulation and the inclusion of the genetic algorithm for optimizing the values of the design parameters. From the perspective of this author, this is what the authors should have tried to explain. In addition, the title of the paper should also have to refer only to the new contributions.       \r\n2.- The comparison with previous works is not clearly stated: In any transactions, this is one of the most important features for guaranteeing novelty and validity of the proposed work; it means, it is mandatory to include the performance comparison of the proposed and related works, in any significant metric. This paper lacks of providing this information, as it is not clearly shown the advantage of the proposed method in contrast to [5] or any other method, aside from confirming the results provided in [5]. \r\nTherefore, this reviewers suggest the authors to show the advantages in terms of ODG and/or BER by using the proposed embedding modification and genetic algorithm, when comparing with [5] and some other previous methods. \r\n3.- The publication of a letter paper in this prestigious journal requires that the proposed paper is practically free from any errors; however, please the following basic mistakes were directly found by this reviewer: \r\na) Before equation (1), a space is found between “follows” and “:”. \r\nb) After equation (1), “M” appears in normal writing while in equation (1) is in italic typesetting. \r\nc) After equation (2), it says: “where S is the symbol phase…”; but where is “S” in the equation? \r\nd) In equation (7), the parameter alpha is introduced, but its meaning was not conveniently explained, as it has not the same meaning in [5]. \r\n\r\nAs an overall conclusion, I suggest the authors to consider refocusing the paper in explaining the importance of the proposed embedded methodology and the use of the genetic algorithm for improving previous works based on rounding of reduced-Arc idea. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions: \r\n1. Is the topic appropriate for publication in this transaction?: Yes \r\n\r\n2. Is the topic important to colleagues working in the field?: Yes \r\n\r\nExplain: \r\n\r\n3.

However, the reviewer still has questions about the following items, and the authors would like to consider them again. \r\n\r\nWhy did the authors set the slot time to 0.2 seconds? It can be understood that the slot time becomes larger because the speed of the sound wave is slower than the propagation speed of the radio wave, but the reason why the value is 0.2 seconds is not explained in the manuscript. In general, the slot time of IEEE 802.11 is defined in consideration of the time for signal detection(CCA), the time it takes for the radio waves to travel(round trip time), and the time it takes for the signal to be transmitted. The size of the slot time is related to the result of packet transmission delay and energy consumption according to the time that the node waits to transmit. Therefore, the reviewer believes that a reason for setting such a value is necessary when changing the slot time. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the slot time of the text is 0.2 seconds, and the slot time of the table is 0.18 seconds. Please recap what you have done with the standard. \r\n\r\nThe authors hypothesized that the communication environment is stable and set a value of 0.5 for the stability factor. However, there is no description of what the definition of a stable communication environment is and why the stabilization factor should be set to 0.5. If the effect on the stabilization factor cannot be shown in this paper, it is also possible to mention separately as a later study item. \r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2 \r\n\r\nComments to the Author \r\nRevised paper is well improved with additional simulation results especially with a variation of the number of nodes. However, some parts are insufficient for the reviewers&#39; comments. \r\n\r\nAdditional revisions are needed for publishing the paper. \r\n\r\n* On Comment 2 of Reviewer 2 \r\n\r\nThough the reviewer 2 requested to add evaluation of the relationship between the performance (delivery ratio and end-to-end delay) and the distance between the sink and source sensor nodes, it is not included in the revised paper. Though a graph for presenting the average number of hops per meter is added in the revised paper, the number of hops and the Euclid distance between source and destination are different. The reviewer is concerned with the performance of the proposed protocol when the distance between the source and destination is long. \r\n\r\n* On Comment 2 of Reviewer 2 \r\n\r\nThough the no_reTx field is introduced in the revised version, the way a receiver of a packet updates the field is not written. Also, though the author mentioned that no_reTx is &#34;a metaphor for number of retransmissions,&#34; the usage of the word &#34;metaphor&#34; seems strange and inappropriate to be used in the context. \r\n\r\nIf a packet from a node that can be sent from any node is damaged, the ID of the sender may be also damaged or not be damaged. If the correctness of the header and the payload of a packet are checked separately with error detection code, the receiver can send NACK to the sender only if the header is not damaged and the payload is damaged. The authors should clarify how the error in a packet is treated in the simulation. Is it assumed that the sender ID is not damaged in the simulation? \r\n\r\n* On Comment 4 of Reviewer 2 \r\n\r\nThough algorithm 1 is updated according to the reviewer 2&#39;s comment, line 5-7 in the revised paper are not needed. \r\n\r\n* On Comment 5 of Reviewer 3 \r\n\r\nThough the reviewer mentioned that &#34;Time calculation by unidirectional communication requires time synchronization between two nodes or packet exchange through bidirectional communication, &#34; the revised paper does not answer to the mention. Since a local clock of computers easily drift, and it is very difficult to synchronize clocks on different computers without communication nor GPS, some assumption is needed for time synchronization in the revised paper or the detailed description how to measure ToA should be included. However, neither is in the revised paper. \r\n\r\n* Misc. \r\n\r\nFig. 15 and 16: The top part of the title of Y-axis is hidden.", "write_date": "2018-08-20T11:29:36Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.134.207", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 163, "fields": {"subject": "Hoa Tran-Dang, Dong-Seong Kim: &#34;Multi-Agent Systems based Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks for Physical Internet&#34;, IEEE Access", "content": "Dear Prof. Kim: \r\n\r\nI am writing to you in regards to manuscript # Access-2018-12217 entitled &#34;Multi-Agent Systems based Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks for Physical Internet&#34; which you submitted to IEEE Access. \r\n\r\nIn view of the criticisms of the reviewer(s) found at the bottom of this letter, your manuscript has not been recommended for publication in IEEE Access.

The reviewer has some concerns. \r\n\r\n1. Some back ground related technologies, such as physical internet, internet of things, industrial wireless sensor networks and agent technologies for industrial wireless sensor networks, has been presented, which are necessary but too lengthy for a technical paper. \r\n2. As the main contributions of this paper, the authors claim that they have proposed two algorithm, one for counting and another for neighbor discovery. However, there are many confusions for the reviewer. First, the counting algorithm looks just like a paging algorithm, i.e., the central controller broadcasts the hello package and other nodes response the controller with ack, which is well studied in available studies for wireless/wired communications. Second, there is also a similar concern for the proposed neighbor discovery algorithm, since this is also a well studied topic for traditional ad-hoc networks. Third, these two algorithms previously have been developed in his theses which has been published in 2017. So, I’m not sure whether they can be again incorporated in this paper as the main contribution or not. \r\n3.

Based on such system, two representative applications are developed to support and facilitate the logistics process in the Physical Internet.

The key idea is to give a higher priority to nodes that are farther away from the center of the UAV communication range such that an improved fairness can be achieved. Simulations based on NS3 are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed MAC protocol. \r\n\r\nThe scenario of UAV-assisted data collection considered in this paper is interesting. However, the reviewer has several major concerns. \r\n\r\n1. This paper considers a simple scenario and makes several important assumptions that seem to be unrealistic. For example, this paper assumes that the sensor nodes are equipped with GPS such that they can track and information their network locations. However, in many cases sensor nodes may not have GPS, and thus, the proposed protocol simply does not work. The accuracy of the GPS will have a big impact on the performance of the proposed protocol, which, however, is not discussed. Also, this paper assumes that UAV and sensors always have enough energy to perform the data collection task. This assumption is unrealistic too as sensor nodes typically are energy-constrained. Energy efficiency should be a key design concern for the MAC protocol. \r\n\r\n2. The key of this paper is to give a higher priority to nodes that are farther away from the center of the UAV communication range. This design seems to introduce a tradeoff between fairness and network throughput, which is not addressed in the paper. In contrast, this paper claims that both throughput and fairness can be improved. This is counter-intuitive and needs to be better explained. \r\n\r\n3. This paper lacks technical depth. The proposed solution is a heuristic only and is evaluated using simulations based on NS3. No theoretical analysis is provided in the paper. The evaluations only compare the proposed protocol with IEEE 802.111 CSMA/CA. \r\n\r\n4. The presentation of this paper needs to be substantially improved. There are a lot of editorial issues (typos, grammatical mistakes, etc.). \r\n\r\n5. Several important issues are not considered in the paper, such as interference in the multi-UAV scenario and optimal UAV flight path design. \r\n\r\n6. Algorithm 1 is confusing. When is &#34;Registeredsensor&#34; increased by one? \r\n\r\nAdditional Questions: \r\n1. Is the topic appropriate for publication in these transactions?: Yes \r\n\r\n2. Is the topic important to colleagues working in the field?: Yes \r\n\r\n1. Is the paper technically sound? If no, why not?: No (explain) \r\n\r\n2. Is the coverage of the topic sufficiently comprehensive and balanced?: Important information is missing or superficially treated. \r\n\r\n3.

It&#39;s not perfectly clear to me how in the transmitter after IFFT and concatenation the values become real (rather than complex). Either the embedding must be done in a way to create a symmetric spectrum, or the complex samples after IFFT have to be turned into real ones by an abs() or real() operation. \r\nThe authors also don&#39;t shed light on what happens if the signals are not only stored digitally but transmitted and distorted by noise. Will the signal quality suffer? Will the embedded signal even be suppressed by noise? This would be really interesting questions for a full paper. \r\n\r\n> *** Paper Type: Do you recommend as an oral or poster paper? \r\nRecommend as Oral Presentation (1) \r\n\r\n> *** Best Paper: Would you recommend this paper for best paper award? \r\nNo (0) \r\n\r\n> *** Main Rejection Reason: What is the main reason you rejected this paper or consider it to be borderline? \r\nNo Reason (0) \r\n\r\n> *** Secondary Rejection Reason: If there was a second reason why your rejected this paper or felt it was borderline please mark here? \r\nNo secondary reason (0) \r\n\r\n> *** Accept Score: Should this paper be accepted for ICCE 2019? \r\nNormal Accept (7) \r\n\r\n> *** Presentation: Readability, English writing \r\nClear (4) \r\n\r\n> *** Contribution: to the technical area and CE field \r\nAverage (3) \r\n\r\n> *** Novelty: Originality \r\nSignificant (4) \r\n\r\n> *** Relevance: to ICCE2019 topics \r\nExcellent (5) \r\n\r\n> *** Grading: Grading Criteria \r\n\r\n\r\n======= Review 2 ======= \r\n\r\n> *** Comment to Author: e.g. Major reasons of your overall recommendation \r\n\r\nIn this paper, the authors present &#34;Transparent Data-Hiding Scheme for High-Quality Audio File.&#34; The perceptual quality of the embedded audio file is changed as minimum as possible which means that there will be no noticeable difference between the original and the embedded audio file by the human ears.

I highly doubt this, as inbterface diversity leads to difficult problems in terms of timing control and synchronization. Thus, a solid discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of such an approach is required.\r\n- It appears that algorithm 1 is the main contribution of the authors. In this algorithm, however, it is unclear how the nodes obtain the required information, where the algorithm is executed, how often this needs to be rerun. I furthermore could not determine where the difference of algorithm 1 is in comparison to exhaustive search. I.e. the authors need to make their research contribution much stronger.\r\n- The numerical evaluation is pointless, from my point of view. I would like to see how - for a practically relevant scenario - algorithm 1 improves the latency characteristic. In particular, I would like to see how this improvement compares to other schemes that are known today for URLLC? In other words, the numerical evaluation needs to demonstrate superiority of the proposed scheme at least in some situations. There is no evidence that points in that direction.\r\n- A careful discussion of the contributions in comparison to state-of-the-art is missing.\r\n\r\n======= JSAC URLLC review 3 =======\r\n\r\n> *** Suitability: Is the paper suitable for the JSAC special issue on URLLC in Wireless Networks?\r\nMarginal (1)\r\n\r\n> *** Originality: How do you rate the novelty of the paper?\r\nMarginal  (1)\r\n\r\n> *** Technical content: How do you rate the technical level of the paper?\r\nMarginal (1)\r\n\r\n> *** Presentation: How do you rate the clarity of the paper?\r\n Somewhat suitable (2)\r\n\r\n> *** Contributions: What are the major issues addressed in the paper?

Why the UAV cannot stop or slow its movement during the mission? \r\n4. Where is the average energy consumption in sleep mode? The sleep mode is not same as idle mode. \r\n5.

The application scenario in this letter is interesting and important. However, the technical content and novelty of this letter are not enough for publication. The detailed comments are as follows: \r\n1, Although the proposed NSL-MAC is used for UAV-assisted data gathering in WSNs, the similar scenarios can be found in UAV-assisted relay communications and reconnaissance. However, the authors do not survey them. \r\n2, The main contribution of this letter has divided the superframe into four periods. The procedure is reasonable, however, many details are ignored. For example, in the registration period, how to handle the collision among so many nodes? Therefore, I think the proposed NSL-MAC is not practical. \r\n3, The nodes become active only when they are in the communication coverage of the UAV. However, because the UAV is mobile, the authors must discuss some issues brought by the mobility of UAV. For example, perhaps the node is in the coverage in the registration period and the UAV assigns some slots to it, but if it is out of the coverage in the gathering period, how to handle? \r\n4, When evaluating the different performance, you should not compare with different protocols. You should have fixed comparative protocols. \r\n5, The presentation needs to be improved. For example, there are too many typos, the authors should check the manuscript carefully. In addition, the format of simulation figures needs to be unified and beautified. \r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3 \r\n\r\nComments to the Author \r\nIn this paper, the authors propose a MAC protocol to improve energy efficiency for UAV sensor networks. This paper has severe flaws regarding the system and simulation results. My detailed comments are listed as follows: \r\n1. Why the coverage area of the UAV is √（R/2）^2+H^2? \r\n2. What is the biggest difference between the proposed MAC protocol and other protocols? The authors need to emphasize the innovative nature of this work. \r\n3. Why the proposed MAC protocol achieves a better PDR than AO-ALOHA? \r\n4. Why the average throughput of the proposed MAC protocol obtains higher throughput when the number of nodes is increasing? \r\n5.

Since the paper is about using VLC in the downlink and UWB in the uplink, the term &#34;hybrid network&#34; in the title is incorrect and misleading. \r\n2. The novelty and significance of this paper is trivial. The concept of using VLC in the downlink and another wireless technique in the uplink is not new. Regarding the performance analysis, there is no mathematical derivation of any closed-form expression. As for the simulation part, no system setup is given, such as OFDM structure, bandwidth, and transmission power. Moreover, there is no comparison between the so-called VUH and the commonly used VLC/IR (infrared) system to validate the suitability of VUH. \r\n3. This paper also lacks a proper literature review. A comparison work between VLC and UWB has been conducted in [1], which is not even mentioned in this paper. \r\n4. Finally, this paper is extremely poorly written.

Moreover, how the presented idea directly impacts radio communications in industrial environments has not been discussed. The dragonfly behaviour as it relates to latency and reliability should also be investigated from a communication theory approach. As this will allow evaluation of its reliability and latency potential from a communications perspective.  While the SDI presented from an algorithm point of view shows that U-BDA outperforms ICA, PSO & GA, the paper hasn’t presented how this concept relates to latency, delay, capacity, radio communication, packetization, communication protocols or network topology. These quantities are essential metrics for URLLC in itself. \r\n\r\nMinor Comments\r\n&#8226;       Sections I, II, III & IV are quite similar to Ref 24. Sections II, III & IV can be put together to probably 2 sections at most with appropriate citation of Ref 24.\r\n&#8226;       Points 4 and 5 in Section III should reflect position of food/enemy. \r\n&#8226;       Figure 1A is poorly presented. \r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\n the idea of using biological dragonfly evolutionary algorithms in the context of URLLC is interesting.  The use case of interest is that of industrial control with stringent constraints.\r\nHaving said that, the article does not provide much insights into the mathematical formulation of the system design. Section III is not enough but serves a background review on known literature. Section IV is too short. The other sections likewise are way too short.\r\nBased on this , i do not recommend this article to be accepted. Lots of efforts are needed in having it in a proper shape to be reviewed.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper investigates Ultra-Biological Dragonfly Algorithm (U-BDA) and relevant applications in industrial systems, authors are requested to:\r\n\r\n-Add new figure at the beginning of the paper to summarize the relevant applications that their studied algorithm may support in industrial world. \r\n-It is not clear what cloud be the improvements that this algorithm may add as authors turn the whole focus on analyzing the algorithm rather than use cases.\r\n-References need to be significantly improved to tackle new literature. \r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 4\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper suggests the use of a novel optimization technique, called ultra-biological dragonfly algorithm (U-BDA), which takes inspiration from the behavior of biological dragonflies, to optimize ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) in industrial wireless networks.\r\n\r\nAlthough the use of biologically-inspired optimization algorithms is interesting for configuring communication networks, I believe this paper fails to make a significant contribution in this field and hence I do not recommend it for acceptance.\r\n\r\nThe main issue is that it is not clear at all which problems the authors are trying to solve in the URLLC framework. There is no clear system model (which wireless networks are being considered? what is the topology, traffic patterns, etc.?) and no clear object functions or constraints (how are latency and reliability defined?). The connection between swarms of dragonflies and URLLC industrial wireless networks is only vaguely mentioned in Sec. II, where the authors claim that &#34;avoidance of collisions&#34;, &#34;alignment&#34; and &#34;cohesion&#34; are the characteristics of a URLLC communication system and that the system should focus on the &#34;targets&#34; while avoiding enemies such as &#34;noise sources&#34;. I believe this explanation is totally unclear for people with industrial communication background. The paper should have a completely opposite structure, in my opinion: start from the description of the URLLC problem, extract a high level model and clearly explain how it can be mapped to the &#34;swarm of dragonfly&#34; scenario and only then discuss an optimization algorithm to solve the original problem. Furthermore, the performance analysis should be targeted at URLLC performance indicators (e.g., latency, reliability, number of nodes, etc.), rather than some vague &#34;test functions&#34;.\r\n\r\nBesides this major issue, I also believe that the language and organization of the paper (too many sections) can be improved a lot.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 5\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nNowadays, several research are focused on emulate the biological behaviors or multiple species, but (in the reviewer opinion) it is not only to select a new specie (new pattern) to create some new application.

It is not clear about the novelty of this paper, in especially unknown wireless environments. Specifically, the reviewer is doubtful who plays the role of the central controller, who knows all states of the unknown wireless channels e.g. shadowing, fading, SINR etc. It is also not clear if the proposed approach is scalable against network sizes with multiple source and destination pairs. If the computation time at the central controller takes too much time, there would be no guarantee the requirement of URLLC applications can be fulfilled e.g latency. The presentation of this paper is also poor with many typos and blurred figures. \r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nComments to the Author:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A so called synergic control scheme for industrial application is proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Moreover, several key issues must be emphasized to the authors for following modification work:\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Altough the industrial application is included in the title, the industry orinted physcial modeling between the nodes are not described.\r\n\r\n     The authors must prove that the presented mathematical modeling could sufficiently reflect the physical link characteristics.\r\n\r\n(2) Why Fig 1 could meet the actual case of the current industry aplication? These is no relevant support found in the current manuscript.\r\n\r\n(3) The quality of all figures are too poor to clearly illustrate the detials. The simulation configurations, parameters, tool and support are  not presented in this edition. The authors must identify that the simulation is detailed enough to the actual application.\r\n\r\n(4) The mathematical description in this manuscript is confusing. No one essential reference is included in this menauscript. Obviously, most of the formula are not proposed or derived by the authors. For instance, (6) and (7) are from the works of Shannon.  \r\n\r\n(5) What is the expression of Noise in this work? Which is the wirless transmission technique in this work? LTE? GSM? WiFi? or others?\r\n\r\n(6) URLLC is one focused topic in 5G, especially for tactile netwrok, AR, or MTC, many schemes have been prosposed to maximize the realibility and  minimize the latency. However, no comparsion is made between the proposed scheme and the reported ones. Although ref [1-5] are included in the  Introduction part, the comparative discusstion could not been found in this edition. This is essential to prove the superiority or real gain  of the proposed one.\r\n\r\n Before above modifcation is made, I can not recommend this paper for publication.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis manuscript proposes a synergy system model for URLLC that aims to maintain the same level of synergy the source and destination. The reviewer believes that the paper has not been prepared well and there are some issues that should be addressed.\r\n\r\n1- The contributions should be clearly explained in Section I.\r\n\r\n2- The English written needs to be enhanced. For example, some sentences are very long and it is very hard for the reviewer to follow them. Further, there are extra “,”s that make it harder to the reviewer to read the manuscript.\r\n\r\n3-  The equations should be aligned to center.\r\n\r\n4- Some notations are not defined. As an example, the sign “V” in the first paragraph of Section III is not defined.\r\n\r\n5- Some presentations like “Algorithm: 2” and “Equation: 8” are not proper for IEEE publications. The authors should use them in IEEE format.\r\n\r\n6- The results and achievements of the manuscript should be compared with the existing models and algorithms.\r\n\r\n7- The references should be provided in IEEE standard format. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 4\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\n-The synergy system model is weak and does not consider the physical aspects of the network as well as the nature of the nodes. Moreover, it is a basic derivation of the standard graph, which cannot be accounted for a novel propagation model. Thus, the authors need to clarify if the propagation dependence is on the existing or the newly formed model. \r\n\r\n-The article uses many well-versed statements without references. This should be avoided.\r\n\r\n-Overall the article is difficult to understand and lacks novelty. There are a lot of metrics considering industrial applications which are missing and the authors should at first define the core architecture used for the study.\r\n\r\n-The algorithm 1 invokes algorithms 2 and 3. It instead could have been done in a single algorithm. However, in that case also, the contribution of the article refers to update on weights, which have been used by a lot of solutions over the years and this article does not add to the knowledge.\r\n\r\n- Eqns (11)~(15) are the best case assumptions under standard mechanisms and the article fails to comply them for ultra-reliability. The actual meaning of ultra-reliability and low-latency are still missing in this article.\r\n\r\n-The mathematical aspects of synergy are weak and there are no analytical proofs to follow. Moreover, the evaluations are standalone and do not provide any detail on how these were conducted and the results were observed.\r\n\r\n-What are the complexities associated with the model? What are the bounds on performance? All these are missing at the moment.", "write_date": "2019-01-28T10:48:28Z", "update_date": "2020-01-08T15:52:57Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 192, "fields": {"subject": "Rizki Rivai Ginanjar, and Dong-Seong Kim, &#34;ELM-Based Real-Time Node Localization: UAV Approach&#34;, IEEE Wireless Communication and Networking Conference (WCNC) 2019, April 15th - 18th, 2019, Marrakech, Maroko (R)", "content": "Dear Mr. Ginanjar,\r\n\r\nWe regret to inform you that your paper #1570495053, &#39;ELM-Based Real-Time Node Localization: UAV Approach&#39;, has not been accepted for presentation at the 2019 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC).\r\n\r\nThe conference received a very high number of submissions and was thus very competitive.

There are many inconsistencies with the material presented in the paper. The results of the scheme show large error for this and the other localization schemes. Performance evaluated through simple simulation and lack of experimental evaluation is insufficient for practical verification.\r\n\r\n> *** Recommended Changes: Recommended changes. Please indicate any changes that should be made to the paper if accepted.\r\n\r\n* As the UAVs are small, the RSSI difference between its two antennas will be small too, especially as compared to the propagation impairments, so the two-antenna system may not work well in practice.\r\n\r\n* It is not clear how the UAVs know how to fly along the blocks. Do the UAVs rely on GPS?\r\n\r\n* The simulations assume in-building and line-of-sight environment. In such an environment there is no problem relying on fixed anchor points for localization. So, this is not a satisfactory evaluation setup.\r\n\r\n* In the in-building and line-of-sight environment there will typically be a lot of multipath fading, but the evaluation does not take this into consideration.\r\n\r\n* Presumably the results will be different with different training environment. So training is environment dependent and there is already the need for fixed nodes for training. Why those nodes cannot serve as anchors for localization also?\r\n\r\n* The results show very large error for all the three schemes, suggesting that this may not be a practical approach. \r\n\r\n* The paper suggests that the error could be reduced with multiple UAVs, but no results are presented.\r\n\r\n* The paper should be reviewed for English presentation style.\r\n\r\n> *** Relevance and Timeliness: Rate the importance and timeliness of the topic addressed in the paper within its area of research.\r\nAcceptable.

(4)\r\n\r\n======= Review 5 =======\r\n\r\n> *** Strong Aspects: Comments to the author: What are the strong aspects of the paper?\r\n\r\nA single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) learning algorithm is proposed for real-time localization technique, based on RSSI values of the beacon signals from mobile anchor nodes. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is used as the learning method to train the SLFN. To improve the localization efficiency unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is used in the WSN because of its flexibility of movement to cover whole area by moving from one coverage area to other. The proposed algorithm uses a single hidden-layer in the neural network to minimize training and testing time compared to other related algorithms. Also, there is no on-the-ground anchor node, offering better scalability compared to other traditional methods, as there is no need to reconfigure the previously deployed anchor nodes if the network size is increasing. Simulation results show that the proposed ELM algorithm outperforms other algorithms (the backpropagation and support vector machine (SVM) learning method) i!\r\nn terms of network training and testing time.\r\n\r\n> *** Weak Aspects: Comments to the author: What are the weak aspects of the paper?\r\n\r\nIt is not explicitly explained how the proposed neural network (NN) algorithm reduces the complexity overhead (as it is mentioned in the introduction), in comparison to previous works focusing on localization techniques in the WSN system, utilizing UAVs to estimate a node position, which they do not use NNs. Also, it is not explicitly explained what is the contribution of the proposed solution, in comparison to previous works that use SLFN and ELM on the node localization process. For example, is it the first time that a UAV-based solution is proposed that uses SLFN and ELM?\r\n\r\n> *** Recommended Changes: Recommended changes. Please indicate any changes that should be made to the paper if accepted.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to explain how the proposed neural network (NN) algorithm reduces the complexity overhead in comparison to previous works focusing on localization techniques in the WSN system, utilizing UAVs to estimate a node position, which they do not use NNs; or not to mention complexity minimization, but another possible advantage. Also, it is recommended to explicitly explain the contribution of the proposed solution, in comparison to previous works that use SLFN and ELM on the node localization process.\r\n\r\n> *** Relevance and Timeliness: Rate the importance and timeliness of the topic addressed in the paper within its area of research.\r\nGood.

However, the developed model is general and does not consider the URLLC features, such as message size, noise, and interference. There is no clear motivation of using such model for URLLC use case. The current structure of the manuscript makes it difficult to follow it. For instance, some papers are cited in the introduction section, while they are not relevant to this work. There are many gramatical errors and problems. Some of these as follow. \r\n&#8226;\tPage 1, line 37: improved mobile broadband (eMBB) > enhanced mobile broadband. \r\n&#8226;\tPage 1, line 41: All types of machine-to-machine (M2M) and device-to-machine (D2M) communication have a mission-critical factor associated with them. JUST SOME OF THEM ARE MISSION-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS. \r\n&#8226;\tPage 1, line 24: Ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) wireless systems are characterized to have minimum latency. WHAT IS MINIMUM LATENCY? \r\n&#8226;\tPage 2, line 59: Equally, low latency is crucial to ensure applications are (??) usable and interactive whether human-to-human, human-to-machine or machine-to-machine communication. \r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2 \r\n\r\nComments to the Author \r\nThe paper proposed a dragonfly-based swarm algorithm for node identification. Although the idea is interesting, there are significant drawbacks in this paper. \r\n1. In Motivation, the authors mentioned multiobjective optimization. However, it seems that a single objective function has been used (cost function-Latency). Moreover, if multiobjective functions are considered, the performance should be compared with the Pareto-front. \r\n2. In simulations, it is not clear what topology has been used. In fact, there is no information related to networks in the simulation. \r\n3. In Fig. 5, the unit of latency was not provided. Even if it is milliseconds, the latency is not appropriate for URLLC where it should be less than 1ms. \r\n4. 60 nodes are not a large-scale network. For example, the authors in [1] have considered a network of 1000 nodes. \r\n\r\nMinor comments: \r\n1.

The paper lacks technical rigour and proper presentation.  I cannot recommend this paper for acceptance. More comments below-\r\n\r\n1. Very basics of dragonfly optimization are unclear. The equations, definitions of variables therein are unclear.\r\n2. How does this apply to URLLC? Which URLLC resources, constraints are being considered? Only mentioning reliability doesn&#39;t qualify. The disconnect from URLLC is apparent from references where only 2 out of 15 references are related to wireless communication (none related to URLLC).\r\n3. What network scenario is being considered? What/where are base stations/users? System model is unclear.\r\n4. Literature survey of swarm optimization in URLLC is inadequate. It should clearly mention what problems have been addressed so far, what are the open areas and what&#39;s the novelty of this work in comparison. \r\n5.

The authors propose priority scheduling algorithm and evaluated the scheme using simulation.\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\nThis paper addresses an important problem in DDS. To guarantee the integrity of messages in DDS, it is necessary to accommodate monitoring system. The authors considered data-mining based monitoring system, which can provide complex monitoring across multiple messages in cost of expensive computation. To provide computation resources to message readers with high priority over semi-batch monitoring processes, the authors developed a simple scheduling algorithm.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe proposed system is very simple and the evaluation is not realistic. While, each tasks has dependency on other tasks in many cases, the authors assume that every task is orthogonal. Also, though the paper implies real-time environment, the scheduling algorithm does not consider real-time deadlines.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is no evaluation results proposed method in the paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\nAccept if room (3)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe paper proposes a system to monitor the DDS messages and detect and cope with errors.\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\nThe proposed system is compared to a basic fault checking system.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- It said that &#34;parallel environment can be implemented by GPU or OpenCL &#34; --> You meand CUDA or OpencL ?\r\n- It is not clear how the simulation was conducted. \r\n- line 6, Alg II: For i<-0 to 2 do --> you mean For i = 0 to 2 (as in Algorithm I) ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\nLikely reject (2)\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nThe authors proposed a priority-based monitoring system in Data Distribution Service environment.\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\nThe authors conduct some simulation experiments and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system in terms of processing time and execution time.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe explain of the proposed system is too abstracted, and the reviewer can not understand the application of the proposed system in the actual network systems.

Some results from MATLAB simulations are included. \r\nThe main drawbacks of the paper are:\r\na) in the motivation part, which does not clarify why this kind of approaches is interesting in the context of IWSNs,\r\nb) the gaps of related literature (related to localization in IWSN) hence the needs for this method, are not clearly described, \r\nc) the lack of discussion on the results. \r\n\r\nWhile c) is acceptable for a WIP paper, the points a) and b) make it difficult for the reader to understand the impact of the experimental outcome as well as the relevance of the proposed method. Also, it appears that the paper is directed to WSN in general, more than specifically to industrial applications(see point a)).\r\n\r\nFollows a list of comments:\r\n\r\n- Abstract - &#34;(...) the proposed algorithm is compared with\r\nseveral different bio-inspired algorithms.&#34; the results show the comparison with only two different bio-inspired algorithms.\r\n\r\n- Section I - The discussion at &#34;In WSN, localization is one of many techniques embedded to gain and monitor every node’s location (...)&#34; is excessively vague. What are the conventional techniques for localization in IWSN and what is the scope of localization in IWSN?\r\n\r\n- Section I - In sentence &#34;(...) location is very important because it can be used to determine the integrity of data in a network.&#34; a reference might be needed. What approaches are the Authors referring to?\r\n\r\n- Section I - &#34;Recently, there are many emerging works related to localization (...)&#34; This section enlists some bio-inspired algorithms but does not motivate the need of the current approach (which is indeed a combination of two of the methods in the literature). What are the shortcomings of other approaches in the IWSN context and what are the related requirements of localization?\r\n\r\n- Section II - The sentence &#34;In this paper, initially, we deploy an industrial WSN (...)&#34; is misleading. The results are from simulations only.\r\n\r\n- Section II - When discussing estimated distance and wireless communication properties, what is the order of magnitude of the error ensured by the various methods (RSSI, TOA, etc.)? The aspect seems relevant since it directly impacts the probability distribution of epsilon in equation (1).\r\n\r\n- Section II - (2) is incorrectly referenced in the text; the parentheses are missing.\r\n\r\n- Section II - What is the challenge of estimating F_obj(x) in (4)? In other words: why is a particle swarm approach more convenient than a traditional estimation method?\r\n\r\n- Section III - Table I is misspelled. The text of this section is generally poorly written (many consecutive short sentences, typos) and needs to be improved. \r\n\r\n- Section III - The sentence &#34;In our simulation, the localization for all nodes is divided into six rounds.&#34; is unclear. Is the process of localization divided into six round or is the whole experiment repeated six times?\r\n\r\n- Section III - In sentence &#34;(...) localization errors of each round are shown in Fig. 2&#34; the reference is incorrect. It should be Fig.4. The remaining part of the analysis is rather superficial.\r\n\r\n- Section III - Which parameters have been used for simulating the other algorithms (particle swarm and dragonfly)? This is important when comparing performance.\r\nWhich MATLAB implementation has been used for the three methods? The latter might affect the computational time, which is also assessed as a performance metric.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------- REVIEW 2 ---------------------\r\n\r\n----------- Overall evaluation -----------\r\nSCORE: 2 (accept)\r\n----------- Review -----------\r\nThis paper proposes using bio-inspired localization methods within WSN, namely Dragonfly Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization. The specific new aspect is considering the limited communication range of all WSN nodes and propagate localization incrementally, starting from a few initial anchors. \r\n\r\nInitially, DA is used and later just PSO is used, which is computationally lighter. This way, the proposed algorithm can reach a trade-off between error (better with DA) and computational power (lower with PSO). This specific contribution of the paper is not clear from the start. Consider being more objective in the Introduction, when describing the proposed approach.\r\n\r\nThe proposal seems worth exploring and the paper already presents some motivating simulation results. There are many open issues, though, that the authors should try to address, even if lightly. \r\n\r\n- How to tune the optimization methods? Both DA and PSO use many parameters that influence the result. \r\n\r\n- How do the results vary with different topology? Running the simulation for varying topology and assess the average error across all of them would allow asserting the influence of the topology in the algorithms comparison.\r\n\r\n- The optimization process explained in section II is what is used by MDS (Multi-Dimensional Scaling). There are many implementations and uses of MDS for localization. Consider referring to them.\r\n\r\n- Eq 5 needs a time-step factor multiplying v_t for dimensional consistency, even if one time unit.\r\n\r\n- In the Introduction, &#34;Localization is usually performed when positioning service by global navigation satellite system such as Global Positioning System (GPS) or Assisted GPS (A-GPS) is unavailable.&#34; Note that GPS also provides &#34;localization&#34; and that A-GPS is GPS.\r\n\r\n- Also in the Intorduction, what is &#34;derivative free&#34;?\r\n\r\nFinally, please, check the English language. There are too many errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------- REVIEW 3 ---------------------\r\n\r\n----------- Overall evaluation -----------\r\nSCORE: 1 (weak accept)\r\n----------- Review -----------\r\nThe authors deals with the topic of localization in wireless sensor networks, exploiting bio-inspired algorithms to both increase the accuracy and lower the computational time.\r\nThe approach presented here is really interesting and deserves attention, and appears timely.\r\n\r\nComments:\r\n\r\n1) related works lacks of some references to machine learning algorithms.

(5) and (6) a CH chooses the relay with the highest instantaneous transmission rate to the BS. However, that only depends on the channel gain of the R &#8211; BS channel and not on the channel gain of the CH - R channel. If this was the case, wouldn’t all CHs select the same Relay? However, the model (shown in Fig. 2) assumes that each CH uses a different Relay. Can the author clarify this point? \r\n\r\n- How is the Amplify and Forward (AF) relay scheme affect the model presented in Section II? There is no mention of the AF relay scheme in the manuscript outside of the introduction. \r\n\r\n- Why do the CHs not consider the channel gain between themselves and the Relay when selecting the Relay to use? Probably a CH will not have the same channel condition to all the free relays. \r\n\r\n- Some of the equations provided in the manuscript lack any explanation or context. I am referring in particular to eq. (15), or the expressions in the box directly above eq. (9) \r\n\r\n- I understand that the results presented in section IV originate from simulations. However, I cannot find any comparison with the analytical results, which the simulations are supposed to validate.

It is written in a confusing way and lacking a clear picture. To start with, the problem and its context are not clearly defined. The main topic seems to be how to optimize communication bandwidth between a number of clients and central servers, but it is not really shown where the problem is, what the problem constitutes, and what the approach is in a nutshell. It seems that one needs hidden background knowledge to understand the paper. Maybe this is because of the military nature of the application, at any rate the reader cannot really understand the message. \r\n\r\n It is well known that time-triggered communication (push type in the context of the paper) needs more bandwidth than event-triggered data transfer (pull type) and that combining the two can give an optimum. However it would have been nice to demonstrate this by means of a concrete example. \r\n\r\n Tables and figures are sometimes confusing. E.g., the x axis in figs. 5-7 reads &#34;times&#34;. Is that individual experiments? Why displaying a time series instead of calculating statistics from a number of experiments? \r\n\r\n Test scenarios (in Tab. III which is labelled 1) are not defined. What are the &#34;input scenarios&#34;? \r\n\r\n Actually, the paper is not work in progress. It looks more like a short paper. The idea of WiP is to present novel ideas and concepts and maybe some preliminary results. As it stands, the paper tries to deliver results like a regular paper, only on 4 pages instead of 6-8. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ----------------------- REVIEW 2 --------------------- \r\n SUBMISSION: 37 \r\n TITLE: Naval Combat System State Management Software using Dynamic PUSH/PULL Technique \r\n AUTHORS: Sung Hwa Park, Moon Seog Kang and Dong Seong Kim \r\n\r\n ----------- Overall evaluation ----------- \r\n SCORE: 0 (borderline paper) \r\n ----------- Review ----------- \r\n The authors propose a state management software based on dynamic PUSH/PULL techniques. Compared with other techniques, dynamic PUSH/PULL techniques minimize message transmissions and thus improve the network load. \r\n\r\n The description of the proposal is fine, although sometimes it is very repetitive. The description would improve if figures 1 and 4 can be put together to be contrasted and compared. \r\n\r\n Regarding the evaluation, to evaluate the performance just checking the system five times is very rare. Statistics as average and standard deviation are much better to evaluate the performance of the system. Furthermore, there is a discrepancy with the caption of Figure 7 and the text. According to the caption, it is comparing data transfer for test items 3 and 4. However, in the text test item 2 is described. \r\n\r\n\r\n Minor comments: \r\n - S/W is not defined \r\n - &#34;Fig. 1 SHOWS&#34; \r\n - The item &#34;4) DB Store Adaptor&#34; in page 2 is also with a bullet point, please check the style \r\n - According to the text after Fig. 3, &#34;An application [...] determines technical status and operational status based on information received from SMC Mgr&#34;.

By using properties of signal from beacon nodes, each unknown node can calculate its distance to each beacon node and localize itself. In some cases, the deployment of beacon nodes cannot completely cover all unknown nodes and make it difficult to get accurate localization and ensure data integrity. This paper proposes the hybridization of Dragonfly Algorithm (DA) with Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) to localize unknown node accurately and efficiently.\r\n\r\nI think the innovation of this paper is not prominent enough. The authors only combine two existing algorithms (Dragonfly Algorithm (DA) and Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) to solve the location problem of sensor nodes. Despite the authors proposed some reasons for doing so, its rationality remains to be further discussed. In addition, these two algorithms have not been merged, but be used in different phases (The exploration phase is handled by DA and exploitation phase is handled by APSO).\r\n\r\nI suggest that the author give more innovative results.", "write_date": "2019-06-24T14:06:10Z", "update_date": "2019-11-06T11:02:04Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 214, "fields": {"subject": "Kevin Putra Dirgantoro, Williams Paul Nwadiugwu, and Dong-Seong Kim, &#34;Real-time Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition using Dual Fieldbus for IIoT&#34;, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 2019.

The paper fails to explain clearly why the exchange of Fieldbus from Modbus to CAN occurs when the error occurs and what happens during communication. \r\n2. Use of Arduino UNO is now equivalent to industrial data acquisition controller. In the paper, it has been written that Arduino replaces PLC devices for cost-cutting. \r\n3. Dual Fieldbus concept already exists as redundancy communication on Vnet / IP protocol with a high standard in the industry. Ex. Yokogawa, ABB, etc. \r\n4. Most of the references used on the basic microcontrollers are DCS, PLC with IOT. \r\n5. Table III shows the data of the receiver where the receiver data rate is 0.25Mbps for Modbus and 20Kbps for the maximum of 1Mbps for CAN for 8pin which normally performs well with 100Mbps to 1Gbps speed communication with the huge number of I / Os. \r\n6. The work is not sufficient for publication in journals TII with high impact factor. \r\n7. The paper can be resubmitted with the use of PLC or DCS. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2 \r\n\r\nComments to the Author \r\nIt is hard to find novelty in your work. The use of arduino is not as reliable as a PLC with its associated ecosystem provided by automation manufacturer. \r\nYour work is a learning framework for students. \r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3 \r\n\r\nComments to the Author \r\nThe main idea behind the paper is a dual fieldbus communication link in an industrial environment, in which the primary bus runs the Modbus RTU protocol and the secondary bus runs the CAN protocol. This architecture would increase the availability of the system as the CAN protocol takes control when there are errors in the primary bus. [7] (GW Adhane and DS Kim, &#34;Distributed Control Systems for Shipboard Engines Using Dual Fieldbus,&#34; Computer Standards and Interfaces, vol., Vol. 11, no. 50, pp. 83-91, 2017). In this paper, we have developed a dual fieldbus architecture for a ship engine system as well as the results obtained. \r\nThe authors claim that the paper has been submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics (IOT), which is a continuation of the study. However, an IIoT environment is much more complex than the solution studied by the authors in this paper. Basically, the authors interconnect a few Arduino boards (one of them for the SCADA) through the dual fieldbus link. A real IIoT system might include robotics, automation, intelligent manufacturing, etc., so much more complex than the simple system described in the paper and shown in figure 8. By extending the complexity of the system, The results presented, and obtained by simulation, would scale to the new complex environment, \r\nThere are additional factors in the paper that lead me to recommend its rejection. SCADA, Modbus, and CAN protocols. All these protocols are well known and it does not justify the use of 3 pages for their description. Actually, the research results are only presented in two pages of the paper, and they are not impressive. It is more or less obvious that the dual fieldbus link will improve the data error rate of the system and also the data success rate. The graphs presented may have been of interest to the environment, but it was not the case. \r\nThe conclusion section is also very concise and basically summarizes what has been done. \r\n\r\n\r\nAE Comments: Reject \r\nAssociate Editor \r\nComments to the Author", "write_date": "2019-06-26T11:56:29Z", "update_date": "2019-11-06T11:01:14Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 215, "fields": {"subject": "Da-Hye Kim, Muhammad Rusyadi Ramli, Jae-Min Lee, and Dong-Seong Kim, &#34;SeamFarm: Distributed Data Analytic for Precision Agriculture&#34;, MobiCom 2019 (Accepted)", "content": "Dear authors, \r\n\r\nThe MobiCom 2019 Demos and Posters program committee is delighted to inform \r\nyou that your submission #44 has been accepted to appear in the conference. \r\n\r\nTitle: SeamFarm: Distributed Data Analytic for Precision Agriculture \r\nbased on Seamless Computing \r\nAuthors: Dahye Kim (Kumoh National Institute of Technology) \r\nMuhammad Rusyadi Ramli (Kumoh National Institute of \r\nTechnology) \r\nJae-Min Lee (Kumoh National Institute of Technology) \r\nDong-Seong Kim (Kumoh National Institute of Technology) \r\nSite: https://mobicom19demos-posters.hotcrp.com/paper/44 \r\n\r\nReviews and comments are appended to this email.

The problem is that the is too\r\nsimple and raises a lot of security issues.\r\nFirst of all, the authors use simple symmetric-key to hide\r\nand authenticate data on the blockchain, so that only who\r\nknows the symmetric key can read and produce transactions.\r\nHowever, how can you be sure that who knows the symmetric\r\nkey is trusted? The philosophy of the blockchain data\r\nstructure is not to trust anyone, not even the members of\r\nthe consortium in the case of permissioned blockchains. This\r\nis the reason why they employ expensive proof-of-work\r\nalgorithm or practical Byzantine fault tolerance protocols.\r\nWithout these protections, a malicious participant can\r\neasily disrupt the blockchain by injecting double spendings\r\nor other incoherent transactions, or even entire alternative\r\nblockchain branches.\r\nEven if ALL the participants are honest, a single symmetric\r\nkey constitutes too-trivial protection. Indeed, what happens\r\nif a participant accidentally leaks the key? The entire\r\nblockchain gets compromised.\r\nMoreover, what&#39;s the need of using a blockchain? You keep\r\ndata private (by encrypting it) and you do not use any\r\nconsensus algorithm (because the &#34;difficulty is zero&#34;). So\r\nwhy do you need a blockchain at all? Can&#39;t you use a\r\nplain-old private database, which is even more performant\r\nand secure?\r\nFinally, the paper is hard to follow also for the bad\r\nstructure and the bad English. Section II.B contains useless\r\ndetails on AES-GCM that can be removed. \r\n\r\nMinor issues and typos:\r\n- the data which chained in the network -> the data which IS\r\nchained in the network\r\n- The participant miners in the network, gather up ... ->\r\nplease do not put commas between subject and verb\r\n- Then concatenates it with IV, -> This sentence seems to\r\nmiss the subject\r\n\r\nReviewer 3\r\nC.

There are several grammar problems that make\r\nthe paper at times very hard to read and understand.\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t quite understand the proposed approach. Because PoW\r\ninvolves too much computational power, the authors propose a\r\nzero difficulty algorithm. Could you give an example? As far\r\nas I understand, this means that the hash does not need to\r\nhave any leading 0. Is that right? In that case, wouldn&#39;t it\r\nbe relatively simple for an attacker to replace some data\r\nand recompute the chain? To offset this problem, the idea\r\nseems to be to encrypt the data. Is this the actual paper\r\ncontribution? Use a zero difficulty problem, but encrypt the\r\ndata?\r\n\r\nThe authors mention lightchain [6], but do not discuss it.\r\nHow does that work compare to what is proposed here? What\r\nare the differences?\r\n\r\nThe authors should spend more time presenting their\r\napproach, instead of discussing in detail how PoW works, or\r\nhow AES works. A short description of these existing\r\ntechnologies, and a reference would be sufficient.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t understand what is shown in Figure 5. Is this the\r\ntime required to add one block to the chain? Or the time\r\nrequired to add all blocks to the chain? In the first case\r\n(add one block to the chain), I don&#39;t see why the time\r\nshould increase with the length of the chain. In the second\r\ncase (add all blocks), I don&#39;t see why the increase for the\r\nblue line should not be linear with the number of blocks. As\r\nfar as I understand the difficulty is not incremented as the\r\nlength of the chain increases. And if it is linear, then it\r\nwould be sufficient to show how long it takes to compute one\r\nblock. Does the time also include communication with the\r\nledger infrastructure?\r\n\r\nThe literature on blockchain for IoT is actually rather\r\nvast, the authors should consider more approaches and\r\nclearly position their work with respect to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccepted or Rejected?\r\nThe manuscript is marked as REJECTED.\r\nThe manuscript is not on the list of registered manuscripts.", "write_date": "2019-07-02T11:36:54Z", "update_date": "2019-11-05T10:57:46Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 218, "fields": {"subject": "Sanjay Bhardwaj and Dong-Seong Kim,&#34;Dragonfly-Based Swarm System Model for Node Identification in Ultra-reliable Low-latency Communication &#34;, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 2019.", "content": "Ref: SWEVO_2019_415\r\nTitle: Dragonfly-Based Swarm System Model for Node Identification in Ultra-reliable Low-latency Communication\r\nJournal: Swarm and Evolutionary Computation\r\n\r\nDear Professor.

The data transmission happens from one node to another through relay nodes, which dynamically reconfigures the network with a new path estimation. This article mainly focuses on the Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) for the industrial networks to be more resilient for node failures. \r\n\r\nDetailed Comments: \r\n1.\tArticle states “re-designing the entire wireless networks”, what does “redesign” mean in the context of article?

In the parent node? Does the path computation results are computed based on a event or proactively applied? Please show in a flow-chart. \r\n7.\tDoes the proposed mechanism follow Software-Defined principles? How does SDN align to the proposed mechanism? Please describe in the related work section. \r\n8.\tIn general, please double check for grammar, spacing, and typos in the article. \r\n9.\tAlgorithm 1 has forward references to Algorithm 2, and Algorithm 3. Can you order these Algorithms in such a way that does not require forward references? \r\n10.\tPlease combine the figures for relative comparison between plots.

Various problems solved by dynamic pricing techniques, importance of various evaluation parameters, limitations of dynamic pricing techniques and their applications are also discussed in this paper. Different taxonomies exploring various issues of dynamic pricing are presented in a structured manner. Then advantages and limitations of various dynamic pricing techniques are also explored. The existing challenges and future research directions of dynamic pricing in ITS are also presented in the paper. Overall, the paper sheds light on different aspects of dynamic pricing schemes in ITS. The paper is well structured, easy to follow and covers extensive literature. Following minor comments would further help to improve the readability of the paper.\r\n\r\n1. The title of the paper includes &#34;smart cities&#34;; however, the abstract does not include a single instance of this word.

In section 3, the authors can discuss briefly about their review method (maybe add a figure depicting the same?) before discussing sub-sections.\r\n\r\n6. As section 4 is an important section of this paper, the authors are advised to write more content in 4.x sub-sections, while the reviewer feels that 4.3.x sub-sections can be merged in 4.3 and can just be represented as simple definitions in boldface font.\r\n\r\n7. Section 4.4 mentions some assumptions about the papers reported &#34;in this section only&#34;. However, the reviewer did not find any reference in section 4. If these assumptions are pre-requisites for section 5, these should be included in section 5 (and not 4).\r\n\r\n8. Even though the authors have created tables to summarise various studies, however, their nutshell outcome should also be discussed in the text such as in Section 5.5.\r\n\r\n9. Some sections are fairly short and discusses just one paper such as 5.2.2, 5.4.2. Authors are advised to add more literature in such sections.\r\n\r\n10. The authors are advised to proof-read the paper before final submission to remove any typos and grammatical mistakes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-Reviewer 2\r\n\r\n  -\r\nHonestly, I find the article very difficult to read. The authors claim that the objective of this paper is to resolve the PDR, and energy requirements which improve network lifetime. Unfortunately, the proposed solution is very difficult to understand. The authors use many objectives, move from one section to another without a clear link.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. It is unclear why a MAC solution reducing transmission power is required for UAVs. How much flight time is gained by this approach? According to my experience, a negligible time.\r\n\r\n2. In a distributed channel access environment, the concept of network throughput is very hard to conceive. The definition provided by the authors seems inadequate. \r\n\r\n3. Brownian motion node mobility model in UAVs will lead to more collisions, on the other side the contention window size is too large for the proposed model. These parameters do not seem to be realistic.\r\n\r\n4. What does &#34;schedule interval is set at 100 with a contention window size of 31&#34;. Do you send a packet every 131 seconds?\r\n\r\n5. There is nothing noble in UAV WSN data gathering model presented by the authors.\r\n\r\n6. Figures need to add more clarity in concepts, and the tables with comparisons state of art techniques should be added. \r\n\r\n7. Please provide numerical performances in comparison to the state-of-the-art mechanisms.\r\n\r\n8. The paper is written with poor grammar and contains awkward expressions that probably appear by using some automatic translation mechanism.\r\n\r\n9. The author is confused between the word UAV and UAVs. \r\n\r\n10. The applications of UAVs need to be explored by the authors. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n-Reviewer 3\r\n\r\n  - The authors have presented NSL-MAC which is a data-link layer UAV-based communication protocol. The aim of this protocol is to improve the performance of the UAV-based data gathering system in WSN along with minimum energy usage. The paper is very confusing as it do not clear the usage of UAV in the proposed protocol. There are several flaws in the overall structure which makes it necessary to rework on the paper to a next level.\r\nThe introduction do not highlight the major motivation behind the proposed protocol\r\n\r\nEven the related work is not able to stress on the novel aspect of the protocol which otherwise is claimed. A comparative table on the basis of different feature should be provided to highlight the novel potentials of the proposed scheme.\r\n\r\nThe role of cloud server is not clear.\r\n\r\nThe font of figures is not consistent, some where it is very large and some places its not legible.\r\n\r\nWhy the ground nodes act as cluster head and how they are selected.\r\n\r\nHow the energy efficiency is achieved is not clear in the paper.\r\n\r\nThe evaluations performed are very limited and no comparisons with existing state of the art is provided Only a single comparison is provided which does not justify the superiority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave questions or need assistance?\r\nFor further assistance, please visit our Customer Support site.

The selection process is based on a routing metric function that considers the residual energy and link reliability for selection the best relay node. The results show improvements in terms of energy consumption, throughput and delay, however the reviewer has the following comments:\r\n\r\n- Since the paper includes many mathematical symbols, it would better if the authors could include a list of all those symbols.\r\n\r\n- Would be better to have a separate section for the related work included in the introduction part.\r\n\r\n- Although the authors include a comprehensive review of the related work, they should clearly emphasize how the proposed work is different of what has been presented in the literature.\r\n\r\n- WirelessHART and ISA100.11a have been introduced as reliable and energy-efficient standards for IWSNs. The authors need to further highlight why routing protocol adopted in these standards are not applicable for the considered time-sensitive IWSNs?\r\n\r\n- Is the energy consumed by transmitting the HELLO messages and their ACKs are considered in the presented energy model?, if not, to how extent these control messages add to the energy consumption.\r\n\r\n- It is not clear whether the denominator of eq. (12) represents the number of hello messages, the number of ACKS or the sum of both?!\r\n\r\n- It is possible that Hello messages and/or the corresponding ACKs are not received. Does these packet loss has a significant effect on the proposed approach? Why?\r\n\r\n- As mentioned in the paper, the rely selection process is for every transmitted packet. How would that affect the energy consumption for industrial applications that have high refresh rates.\r\n\r\n- It can happen that many nodes attach to the same rely node, due to its low hop-count, good link quality and high residual energy, which in turn causes a congestion to that node and adversely affects the network performance. How the proposed approach could deal with such problem?\r\n\r\n- It would be better if the authors introduce a brief complexity analysis of the proposed work including the added computational complexity, storage and communication overhead. That is to highlight the trade-off for the acquired performance improvements.\r\n\r\n- Is the 35m communication range considered in the simulation is practical value for the short range UWB communications?\r\n\r\n- What is the confidence interval of the obtained results?\r\n\r\n- How the End-to-End delay values are calculated in the simulations, average or worst-case?\r\n\r\n- Overall revision of the paper writing and structure is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe authors present a routing strategy which takes into acount the energy consumption required to relay the data.\r\nThe authors claim this is of use for industrial wsn but this is a fairly weak claim as they do not connect any of their results to industrial application requirements. The mention time sensitive applications as a target application for the proposed solution but without connecting to what is required. The same is true for reliability (the packet delivery ration in the paper).\r\nThis is also furthermore being questioned since there are no references to work done for IWSN by industrial researchers at, e.g. Emerson, ABB, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are several unclear parts in the paper:\r\n- Does this approach take into account the whole path before selecting the next hop or not?\r\n- What is the overhead in terms of energy to compute the paths: there are several non data messages sent to estimate the best path: the Hello(w) message, the RReq, RAck and information messages. Why not combine a few of these messages?\r\n- It is unclear what the authors mean with end-to-end delay? The packet overhead to determine the path must have a sever impact on this? In industial applications, end-to-end delay is normally measured from when the sensor data is being generated at the sensor in the source node until the data can be used at the destination, not from when it is being transmitted (after determining the optimal path) to when it is being received.\r\n- Is Algorithm 1 being performed in all nodes along the route before the data packet is being transmitted from the source?\r\n- It is unclear if the experiments use the IEEE 802.15.4 radio or just the CSMA/CA algorithm (which is not exclusive for 802.15.4)?\r\n- Looking at table 1: simulation parameters it cannot be the 802.15.4 radio used for simulation as several parameters (data packet size, data rate) does not correspond to the 15.4 specs. Which radio is then simulated?\r\n- For the experiments it is unclear what a round is? The authors state that it is &#34;time allocated to transmit data packets from source to destination&#34;. What does this mean? Allocated or time taken?\r\n- The experimental results in Fig. 6 is unexplained: why does the end-to-end delay increase for over the number of rounds? The same is true for Fig.8: why does the energy consumption increase? I guess i dont understand what a round is.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nIn this paper, the authors proposed a routing metric to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of IWSNs. Several major issues are found in this work:\r\n1) The authors claim that the proposed method is for industrial WSN. However, I did not see anything particular for industrial settings or environments. It seems for general WSN, not for IWSN.\r\n\r\n2) The proposed scheme required positioning information by using &#34;Ad hoc positioning system&#34;. Firstly, it requires additional energy. Secondly, I doubt the accuracy of the positioning information by using that localization scheme. Moreover, the authors are using 802.15.4a. One of the main advantages of UWB is localization. So why not have your own localization scheme?\r\n\r\n3) The network model seems an outdoor model. However, most of the industrial environments are indoor, full of various obstacles. Moreover, the authors are using 802.15.4a. Due to the weak penetration ability of UWB, I do not think this model works in industrial environments.\r\n\r\n4) No implementation. UWB chips are available now. Please consider real implementation and measurements in industrial environments.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 4\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nFor my comments pls. refer to the attached file.\r\n\r\n\r\nAE Comments: Reject\r\nAssociate Editor\r\nComments to the Author\r\n\r\nDate Sent:\r\n\r\n27-Oct-2019\r\n\r\nFile 1:\r\n\r\n- review.pdf\r\n\r\nFiles attached\r\n\r\nreview.pdf\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n&#169; Clarivate Analytics |  &#169; ScholarOne, Inc., 2019.

However, some major issues have made the evaluation very hard. Specifically,\r\n- The paper lacks focus. The term “data hiding” is a general term that covers several different techniques including steganography, watermarking, and fragile watermarking. It is not clear what is the focus of this work. Does it propose a watermarking algorithm, or a steganography method? This delineation would make a huge difference in terms of the evaluation criteria.\r\n- Aims and significance of the work are not clear. Specifically, what are the problems that the proposed method is trying to address? And why are they important?\r\n- Novelty of the paper is another issue that needs to be addressed. Authors are encouraged to spell out the novelty of their proposed method and how it is different from other works. For example, what are differences between this work and the reference 22, which is by the same authors and on a similar topic?\r\n- The paper lacks a smooth and logical flow. This is in part due to continuously jumping between watermarking and steganography methods.\r\n- Writing of the paper needs major revision and proofreading.\r\n- In the experiment section, very important pieces are missing. This is in part due to a lack of focus. If the method is a watermarking algorithm its robustness to different attacks should be investigated. If it is a steganography its security should be investigated.\r\n- Using a single secret data is not enough and average performance of the system over multiple messages should be reported.\r\n- Specifications of the dataset is missing. How many files? What types of audio files were used? How many speeches and how many music samples were there in your dataset? How were they acquired? What was the history of the files? Were they transcoded from a different format, or were they in the raw format?\r\n- No comparison is done with the best and up to date alternatives!\r\n- Information in table II seems to be incorrect! Assuming audios with 44100 Hz and 16bit resolution, the bit rate of the host would be about 705kbs. How could you hide 5488kbs in a 705kbs host???!!!! This is a direct violation of the information theory!\r\n- The references are not adequate, and the related work section lacks a fair comparison with existing approaches. You may consult with existing great review papers on audio steganography, audio steganalysis, and audio watermarking.\r\n\r\nSome minor issues:\r\n- Abstract, “The performance of the proposed system has …”. Often, the term “the proposed system” refers to the work that you are proposing in the paper. Probably, existing or previous is a better choice.\r\n- Abstract, introductory part of the abstract should be reduced. Instead, state the rational of the project, its significance and then present the method and give some objective numbers showing the performance of the system in comparison to the best existential alternatives.\r\n- “The wavelet domain …” paragraph is repeated twice!\r\n- Note that cosine and sine are also frequency domain transformation. Putting them in the same paragraph as wavelet adds to the confusion of the readers.\r\n- “while the robustness of the secret data can be measured from the bit error ratio (BER)”. Please note that robustness is defined in the presence of active attacks! What you are measuring is the correct recovery rate, not robustness.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1.

How would you rate the technical novelty of the paper?: Not Novel\r\n\r\nExplain: I will speak from the point of view of someone who has closely followed the field of digital data hiding almost since its inception in the late 1990s.\r\n\r\nThe authors propose a  seemingly reasonable data hiding method for audio signals. However there is very little novelty in their proposal. Unfortunately, there are precious little signs of engagement with existing data hiding research in the manuscript. The references are either dated or of little relevance.\r\n\r\nIn essence the authors&#39; proposal boils down to the application of Quantization Index Modulation (QIM) on the phase space of an audio signal. There is nothing new here, but it is significant that the authors do not even mention the pioneering paper by Chen and Wornell on the topic. f they had, they would have become aware that distortion-compensated QIM (DC-QIM) improves on the robustness of QIM, by making the embedding procedure perform closer to the theoretical limits first discovered by Costa in 1983 for channels with side information at the encoder (like the data hiding problem).\r\n\r\nThe one contribution this paper could have had would have been an analysis of the _perceptibility_  issues associated to their method. However the authors gloss over this important question, especially given the fact that phase information  very relevant psychoacoustically. How would a &#34;golden ear&#34; like this method?\r\n\r\n3. Is the contribution significant?: Not Significant\r\n\r\n4.

It may also causes some serious interference (and hence service degradation) from the CR users to primary users.  Please discuss the acquired performance gain (in terms of enhanced spectrum efficiency, system complexity and primary user QoS) for using overlay cognitive radio instead of underlay CR (if there are any gain). Recall that in underlay CR the secondary user (CR user) is allowed to access the spectrum simultaneously with the primary user as long as the interference caused by the secondary user on the primary user falls bellow some predefined threshold value.\r\n- What is the distribution of ‘h’? And how it affected the calculation of probability of active primary user (Eq. 4).\r\n- Rewrite Eq. 4 in a more suitable form (usually the probability of an event is written as p(event)).\r\n- Please proof read the whole manuscript and fix all grammatical and spelling mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper studies spectrum management in cognitive radio networks by proposing a primary user localization method that uses the RSSI (received signal strength indicator) values measured by distributed sensing devices. However, the language and the presentation of this paper is poor, some concepts are not clearly motivated and explained, the overall contribution and quality of the paper in the current form is not suitable for publication in this journal. Therefore, I recommend reject this paper in its current form due to following comments, and suggest to the authors to carefully refine their work and address the listed concerns before the resubmission:\r\n1. The novelty of the paper and the technical contribution is rather incremental.\r\n2. In the introduction section, the concept of spectrum sharing is not fully explained, in particular, the authors did not mention the schemes of the spectrum sharing (i.e., underlay, overlay, and interweave) to give the whole picture. Moreover, in the key contribution list, point (1) and point (3) should be combined as a single point.\r\n3. In section 2, the motivation about GPS is kind of irrelevant to this work, it is better to focus on the RSSI methods and give the state of the arts for the specific approach of primary users localization in spectrum sharing networks.\r\n4. In Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), the parameter (n) is not clearly explained, and the authors use first \\eta(n) and then \\eta without (n), please address this confusion. Also, path loss exponent is set to its smallest value while it is in very the rich scattering propagation environment.\r\n5. In the proposed solution, the authors suggest to collect information and store it in mapping database and one of the information is “size of the antennas (especially the height)” but it is not clear how to acquire this information!\r\n6. In REM based localization technique, since it only considers the non-line-of-sight fading, the Rician propagation model should represent the scattering environment to make your solution technically sound.\r\n7. There is no reference for the considered Kriging interpolation technique, and it is not mathematically described.\r\n8. \\alpha_k, \\alpha_l, and \\alpha_m, are computed by least squares fit, where is the equation for this calculation?\r\n9. The problem in Eq (16) does not follow the correct optimization formulation.\r\n10. Number of sensors is a key aspect in this system model, however, its optimization with respect to other parameters is missing.\r\n11. The performance of the proposed scheme is not investigated versus the number of the severed secondary users.\r\n12. The references list does not follow IEEE standard, specifically the abbreviations of the journal names, they need to be in IEEE style.\r\n13. This manuscript has many typos and grammar errors, and some of the sentences are confusing and not clear, so a careful and significant proofread is highly recommended.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper makes use of Kalman Filter to estimate the PU transmitter location and track its movement. Kriging interpolation is used to construct the radio environment map. My comments are highlighted below.\r\n\r\n1. The paper lacks novelty as KF and Kriging interpolation is a common approach for tracking and mapping. Lots of work has been carried out in this direction. For example, [1], [2]. Thus, paper contribution is not clear.\r\n2. Further, how this localisation information is made use of to enhance the secondary users performance is not explained/understood. How Figs. 9 and 10 are arrived at are not understood.\r\n3. For CR operation, it is required to safeguard the PU receivers and not the transmitters. In this paper, PU transmitters are tracked instead of receiver. I do not see any benefit from this mechanism.\r\n4. There are lots of typos in the paper. Please rewrite.\r\n\r\n[1] R. Yang and Y.

The topic itself is very practical and interesting. However, this paper is not well written and organized. My main comments are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The main weakness of this paper is the performance evaluation part. Too few results are given. It’s really hard to draw the conclusions that “The proposed system can maintain the traffic to avoid the congestion” from Figures 8 and 9. More results like metric scores like accuracy, delay, waiting time should be given not just the dotted figures.\r\n\r\n2. Comparisons of the proposed deep reinforcement learning methods with other solutions are missing. There is a great body of literature on this problem either by using DRL methods or traditional methods.  The authors are required to compare the proposed DRL approach for optimizing the traffic signal with more recent work since it is difficult for the readers to find the advantages of the proposed algorithm without comparing to other stat-of-arts algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The main contributions and novelties of this paper should be clearly listed in the introduction section.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Some equations like 1~3 can be replaced by their transposed matrix to save some space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Variables should be italic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. How is the computation complexity of the proposed DRL approach compared with other methods?\r\n\r\n7. Too much effort is spent on the introduction of traffic control system, but less time is spent on the new proposed approach.\r\n\r\n8. This paper is just like a simple combination of DRL and traffic control system. More focus should given on the theoretic analysis and algorithm analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Reviewer 4\r\n\r\n  -\r\nThis paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to optimize traffic-light signals under three traffic conditions (traffic congestion, emergency vehicle, and vehicle collision). \r\n\r\nHowever, the main contribution, in my opinion, is that the authors utilize the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm optimize traffic-light signals under three traffic conditions and analyze the traffic condition, which is not innovative enough. The lack of good insights makes it virtually impossible to provide a novel perspective on the traffic data analysis; the lack of discussion on the generalization disables the engineering usage of the platform. The investigation of related work is not sufficient as well. Generally, the contributions in this paper are weak.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Reviewer 5\r\n\r\n  -\r\nI would like to recommend that the paper go through following revisions, particularly:\r\n\r\n1) Describe more deeply the Edge- and Cloud-architecture. Not only by a basic logic view but particularly with more technical details.\r\n\r\nAccording to the authors: .....Furthermore, the DRL algorithm is implemented in the edge computing-based TLCS. The communication latency and computation process can be reduced by leveraging edge computing in the TLCS. \r\n\r\nPlease, this assumptions have to be explicitly proved/validated.\r\n\r\n2) According to the authors: ..... The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce vehicle waiting time in intersections under the three mentioned conditions....\r\n\r\nPlease, clarify that these results are from a Simulation Approach. The authors should emphasize the necessary condition for transfering simulation´s results to real environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3) Section 5.2 is based on the application of a simulation approach referenced by [13]. \r\n\r\n3.1) Please complete this reference, because is not easy to find it in the international data bases.\r\n\r\n3.2) Which is then the value of the simulation approach here in this paper?. Is it only the use of the Tool?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4) In order to transfer your results to a real environment, which are the requirements for both, the environment and the Edge- and Cloud-Architecture? Making this kind of analysis, the authors will be able to emphasize the potential impact of their approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5) Please, as indicated for reference [13], also check other reference for completness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-Reviewer 6\r\n\r\n  -\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two critical issues about this work:\r\n\r\nOne of the main drive factors for this work to integrate edge-computing is “reducing the transmission and computation time”. However, it is not a reason strongly supported by any listed literature. The authors need to provide a stronger problem statement.\r\nThe transportation simulation model is not validated. The parameters are defined without clear reasons. For example, why each episode is 1.5 hours. Does it represent realistic traffic conditions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-Reviewer 7\r\n\r\n  -\r\nThe authors proposed an edge computing-based TLCS architecture for leveraging traffic signal optimization by using deep reinforcement learning. The study is interesting and well presented.\r\n\r\nI suggest to better address the following issues:\r\n\r\n-      - -  In section 5.1.3, you should describe why and how you chose those values for the parameters in order to better motivate the choice regarding the discount factor, the update rate and the learning rate.\r\n\r\n-       - Since the use of learning techniques is very hot in literature, you should add a related work section in which you can cite and describe recent applications of reinforcement learning  techniques in different context before to focus the work on traffic control systems.

Hence, the contrast of claimed contributions versus state-of-the-art is missing.\r\nThe problem definition in Section II is quite shallow and confusing due to several missing details such as who is sending energy and who is harvesting (drone or IoT), what are the involved components (IoT ground devices, drone, ...etc.), what is the main issue, ...etc.\r\nWhat is the justification of using FBM with Hurst 1/2 for modeling the system at hand?\r\nEquations (6) & (7) are confusing and have no reference nor justification.\r\nEquation (12) & (13) are very awkward since they have P_{Trans(max)} and P_{Trans(min)} appearing in the Nominator and Denominator in both cases, respectively.

The authors have modeled the movement of the UAV to follow a Brownian motion model, and then attempted to optimize the amount of harvested energy of the ground nodes.\r\n\r\nThe paper is not clearly presented. For instance, the Simultaneous Transmission and Energy-Harvesting Scheme sub-section and most of the System Model section are taken from reference [9] in the paper, and the Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM) subsection is taken from reference [10] in the paper. The most important part of the paper, which is Eq. (15), is not discussed at all. Hence, it is not clear to me how does the Brownian motion of a UAV is involved in this work. Is the UAV forced to follow a Brownian motion model to maximize EH, or is this a practical modeling of the UAV’s trajectory? Moreover, it seems to me from the results, particularly the result depicted in Fig. 4, that the UAV follows a much longer path when compared with the benchmark trajectory, thus compromising the energy efficiency of the UAV. Perhaps if the paper was significantly re-structured, the contributions could be clearer.\r\n\r\nA few more comments regarding the presentation of the paper are below:\r\n\r\nIn general, it is quite challenging to read the paper as the language can be improved.\r\nSome acronyms are not defined, e.g. SWIPT and WPT.\r\nThere is a problem with the references in the paper. For instance, the reference mentioned in Page 1, line 58, second column does not discuss Eq. (2) at all. The same for the reference mentioned in Page 2, line 20, left column.\r\nIn Page 2, left column, line 22: The reference (Mandelbrot and Van Ness 1968) has the wrong format and not mentioned in the references.\r\nPage 2, left column, line 2: \\lambda is the wavelength and not the efficiency parameter. I think you meant \\eta instead.\r\nPage 2, left column, line 34: this is not the definition of the Gamma function.\r\nIn Eq. (12), shouldn’t the denominator be a function of P_{Trans(max)} instead of P_{Trans(min)}? The same for Eq. (13), shouldn’t the denominator be a function of P_{Trans(min)}?\r\nSome parameters in Eq. (15) are defined after mentioning them, and others are not even defined.\r\nSome parameters in Table II are not defined in the text (Dropout, Conv 2D).\r\nWhat are the Benchmark methods in Fig. 3. What does “Iterations” mean for the x-axis?\r\nWhat is the unit of time in Fig. 5?\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nAuthors have utilized UAVs as a hub-point between base station and IoT devices in a battle environment. In such a scenario, authors argued that a major concern is the energy requirement of the IoT devices, thus, they proposed an energy-harvesting technique along with trajectory optimization of the UAVs to ensure the longevity of IoT devices.\r\n\r\nMainly, because of the poor writing style, it is difficult to follow the presented concepts. The authors have claimed in the contributions that they have presented an energy harvesting scheme along with the trajectory optimization. In the system model, they have presented such a technique in eq (15), however, it is not properly stated that how they have optimized this equation. Thus, the solution of the presented idea is unclear.\r\n\r\nThe eqs from (4-8) related to brownian motion were stated, however, unused in relation to the maximization problem.\r\n\r\nThe optimal solution presented in Fig. 3 is compared with two benchmark techniques, however, the authors have not mentioned those techniques with proper references anywhere in the paper.\r\n\r\nIn Table 2, authors have mentioned Conv 2D and Dropout values, however, they have not explained their use in any equation.

The choice of 256-bit AES goes in the right direction but doesn&#39;t take into account latest quantum cryptanalytic results on the same, that will likely lead to a re-evaluation of the actual strength of AES-256 against quantum computers large enough to break RSA and ECC (expected in the next decade), itself the basis for asymmetric post-quantum ciphers&#39; evaluation. See https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1146 for details.

However, the number of tested protocols as well as the number of experiments is very limited. The description of materials and methods used in the experiments could be  improved. Legends should be added to figures. The descriptions of the figures in the text does not always correspond with the figures.\r\n\r\nA deficiency in the English expressions of the paper has been identified. Please have the paper polished by a professional English editor or native speaker. Please ensure that the numerous grammatical and punctuation errors are corrected throughout the manuscript.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed remarks (see below):\r\n\r\nHighlights:\r\n\r\nLine 4: a word is missing: “Experimental results show the ???? can maintain the network performance of system.”\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nRephrase the sentence: “Generally, the internet of things (IoT) system for agriculture application is deployed in the large area in which consist of significant interferences”: suggestion “...is used in an environment where significant interferences can occur”.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRephrase the sentence: “Thus, in this paper, the adaptive network mechanism is designed to achieve reliable for a smart farm….can be maintained”: suggestion: “In this paper an adaptive network mechanism is designed to improve the network performance of the system, in order to achieve a more reliable smart farm system.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat do the authors mean with “…to send sensor reading data which only have small amounts size of data” ??? you can have the size of data files (in bytes) and the amount of data that can be stored ….but what means “small amounts size of data” ?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nLine 13: “In the agriculture environment, commonly the system is deployed in …”: specify the name of the system: “smart farm system” or “IoT system” or ????\r\n\r\nLines 14 to 15: suggestion to change in : “Therefore, it is very sensitive to failures while …”\r\n\r\nLines 24 to 25: suggestion to change in “….on IoT-based smart agriculture systems.

The measurement test was carried out with two different scenarios: a vertical and diagonal test, illustrated in detail in Fig. 4.”\r\n\r\nPlease explain what you mean with vertical and diagonal test and make it more clear in the figure.\r\n\r\nUse a legend in figure 4: meaning of coloured cross, black dots, etc.\r\n\r\nLine 213: “…requires another hop …”\r\n\r\nLine 220:  “Fig. 7 depicts our testing scenario for the outdoor measurement test. “\r\n\r\nAdd a legend to fig. 7 (see remark on fig. 4)\r\n\r\nIn line 222 to 223 the authors refer to Fig. 8 and the fact that the lowest average RSSI value is obtained at the distance of 748 m.

The information on the systems is not new or innovative, but the test data may be useful.   It would greatly help the manuscript if there was just some more performance data.  Either in replications or in some new situations.   It should not take that much more time since the systems are already there---can it be done?\r\n\r\nThe manuscript is of an appropriate length.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodsX (optional)\r\n\r\nWe invite you to submit a method article alongside your research article.

The method could successfully provide full coverage of ROI while enable to deploy sensors and localise them with a high accuracy. It would be great if authors could enhance the body of literature with some known related methods and show how the proposed platform outperforms those methods.\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\nDoes the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: yes\r\n\r\nIs the paper technically sound?: yes\r\n\r\nIs the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: Almost yes\r\n\r\nAre the references provided applicable and sufficient?: Acceptable.

For example, a curly bracket in equation (3) is missing and not completed. From Principle 2 it looks like that the paper only addresses barrier coverage. There are many interesting barrier coverage paper and those are not well surveyed. This issue of coverage itself is not addressed in a comprehensive manner. There are different types of coverage: area, barrier, point of interest, information coverage and related various types of figure of merit. These issues are also coupled with the sensing and communication model. However, these issues are not well covered in this paper. Also, there are some optimal deployment patterns and the issue of patter mutation as the ration of communication radius and sensing radius changes.

In the Performance Evaluation section, the lines  &#39;Fig. 4 shows that the accuracy rate of our IC-AMCNet still outperforms the other algorithms. The highest accuracy of IC-AMCNet 0.4 dropout is around 81.43% at SNR 18dB, where for CNN1, CLDNN, CNN2, NN2 hidden layers, and IC-AMCNet 0.7 dropout is 78.75%, 82.28%, 80.49%, 59.85%, and 82.89% respectively.&#39; are contradicting. CLDNN has better accuracy than IC-AMCNet. Further, based on the plot, it is hard to see the proposed method is performing better than other algorithms.\r\n3.

Ju\r\nEditor\r\nICT Express\r\n\r\nComments from the editors and reviewers:\r\n-Reviewer 1\r\n\r\n  - This paper investigated the exponential Gaussian process regression (EGPR) for training and predicting antenna configuration in MIMO system of 5G for improved capacity utilization. The interesting point was to use Machine Learning tool of Matlab to predict performances, but the comparison results with other schemes were not clear and the most of results are straightforward, not interested. In my opinion, this paper needs to show more clear and detail descriptions, particularly in comparison parts. Overall, the contribution of the paper is some limited in general. I hope that the editor can make a fair decision with other reviewers’ comments. \r\n\r\n\r\n-Reviewer 2\r\n\r\n  -\r\nIn this paper, the authors have proposed to adopt the exponential Gaussian process regression (EGPR) as the kernel for the performance evaluation of MIMO antenna configuration. However, the following comments may give some help.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- At the 5th line of the second paragraph of Section 1: was -> were\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- At the 23th line of the second paragraph of Section 1: has -> have\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- At the 22th line of the third paragraph of Section 1: Fig.[1] -> Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- At the 1st line of the first paragraph of Section 3: Gaussian process regression(GPR) -> GPR\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- Please clarify the sentence at the 3rd line of the second paragraph of Section 3: computing the ergodic capacity (C) or spectral e&#64259;ciency will by equation (6)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- Please clarify the sentence at the 6th line of the second paragraph of Section 3: s is the scaling factor which is a function of the ratio of Tx and Rx and signal-to-noise ratio(SNR).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- Please specify what are Ai and Pi at (7).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, there are very high error margins. For example, when the number of transmit antenna is 5, there is 90% error at Fig. 2. Therefore, it seems that the GPR prediction is not suitable for performance evaluation of MIMO antenna configuration. The errors in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 are tolerable to evaluate the MIMO antenna configuration?", "write_date": "2020-01-13T18:21:49Z", "update_date": "2020-01-14T14:14:33Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 251, "fields": {"subject": "Rubina, &#34;Low-Latency and Energy-Ef&#64257;cient Trickle-based Scheme for Low-Power & Lossy Industrial WSN&#34;", "content": "Dear Prof. Dong-Sung Kim:\r\n\r\nThe review of the referenced manuscript, WCL2019-1235, is now complete. I regret to inform you that based on the enclosed reviews and my own reading of your manuscript, I am unable to recommend its publication in IEEE Wireless Communications Letters.\r\n\r\nYour paper may not be resubmitted for review. The reasons for this are as follows: The reviewer has some major concerns on the novelty of your submission. They are also not satisfied with the literature review since most references are out-of-date. In addition, as pointed out by Reviewer 3, the contribution is rather limited since the proposed approach is optimistic and sub-optimal. The reviewers also suggested that the paper is not well presented with lots of typos grammatical errors. Based on the above-mentioned weakness and with my own reading of your submission, I have to decide to reject your submission.\r\n\r\nThe reviewers&#39; comments are found at the end of this email.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting your work to the IEEE Wireless Communications Letters.

If the interval\r\nlength exceeds the value of Imax, then it directly resets I to Imax only so here there is no need for IF ELSE statement.\r\n\r\n2) The authors should point out the eventual shortcomings of the proposed scheme compared to the related existing works.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\n1. This work has made a slight modification upon the standard trickle algorithm. The novelty is quite limited.\r\n2. The authors should clearly present the motivations behind the modifications. For example, random time t is selected from [0, i_min/3^{s+1}] instead of the original trickle range (i/2, i). However. why the upper bound is i_min/3^{s+1}, but not i_min/2^{s+1}?\r\n3. The literature review is so weak. Actually, I can not find any related works. What&#39;s more, there is even no reference to these two benchmark algorithms, namely E-trickle and I-trickle.\r\n4. The presentation should be considerably improved. Significant copy editing needs to be done as there are a large number of syntactic and grammatical errors.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper proposes to modify the trickle timer operation for fast data dissemination in a low-power, lossy wireless sensor network. The modification is a simple choice of reduced period for broadcast timer, t. However the work seems out of time, not enough motivation, not enough substantiation on the proposal and not convincing results. There&#39;s no insight to the gains and the article is preliminary in its contribution.\r\n\r\n1. The work seems to be outdated as most of the references are 2011. Furthermore, new low-latency protocols such as LWB for WSNs have been proposed. They are not even cited.\r\n2. As stated in the abstract, this proposal is optimistic and sub-optimal. What is the need then for this protocol? Clearly motivate and show the shortcomings of the work\r\n3. Clarify what you mean by IoT is a self-controlled network.\r\n4. There&#39;s a sharp difference in writing between the first 2 paragraphs of the rest of the paper. The rest of paper is not well written and with lot of typos.\r\n5. What is the need of tying trickle with RPL? Trickle is a generic timer and can be used for a variety of things.\r\n6. While the title has &#39;Industrial WSNs&#39;, the word is just a random usage and the work does not relate to it.\r\n7. The proposal is to reduce the timer interval within which t is chosen. This has been set to [i/2, i] for a reason as mentioned in the RFC. By changing it, it would obviously reduce latencies but you will sacrifice with a lot of packet losses. This is not even discussed in the paper. Any sort of reasoning is not provided in the paper as to why 3^s is chosen along with any definition for the parameter &#39;s&#39;.\r\n8. While it is clearly mentioned in RFC6206 that changes would bring in sub-optimal results in edge cases, the authors have not cared to evaluate it well. The evaluation is basically a few runs of the simulator without any consideration of whether the simulation is close to reality. The results are not discussed and no insights are provided. The gains indicated are not significant at all.", "write_date": "2020-01-14T12:19:46Z", "update_date": "2020-01-14T14:13:42Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 252, "fields": {"subject": "Gaspard, &#34;Efficient-Spectrum Management Based on Localization of Primary User Position Toward 5G&#34;", "content": "Ref: PHYCOM_2020_15\r\nTitle: Efficient-Spectrum Management Based on Localization of Primary User Position Toward 5G\r\nJournal: Physical Communication\r\nDear Professor.

I think this is not very realistic case.\r\nIn figure 5, how was decision time found? Do you require some certain PD or?\r\nIn figure 6, PD values are very low. Real systems require\r\nPD >= 0.90 (at least). It seems even at high SNR Fig. 6 get only 0.05 PD\r\nTypically, with energy detection we assume that PFA is fixed. Alternative is that PD is fixed. But in this paper both PD and PFA vary.\r\n Throughput values in Megabits/s/Hz in figure 10 seems extremely high.

The proposed algorithm is well compared with the other existing optimization algorithms. The proposed solution approach is very interesting and appears having competitive performance.  However, I have following comments about the manuscript.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMajor Comments:\r\n\r\n1. In my opinion, the multi-objective optimization framework (objectives) is not well (explicitly) connected with the mentioned &#34; resource scheduling for URLLC in Industrial Wireless Network&#34;. To this reviewer, this is the one of the concerns about this work. The organization of this paper needs to be improved to avoid any potential confusion in this regards.\r\n\r\n2. The optimization framework is interesting; however, it is confusing how the defined objectives involving important metrics like resource scheduling variables, latency, and reliability are defined to be solved with DSCCA. Also, can the authors simplify the representations to improve readability of the manuscript?\r\n\r\n3. The convergence and coverage analogy for the dragon flies and the stringent requirements of URLLC is unclear to this reviewer. The authors should provide some insights and establish this argument.\r\n\r\n4. How the gain criterion (5) is derived? Is the equation balanced?\r\n\r\n5. In (15), the connectivity ratio is defined as C_r = n/m.  The authors should explain this term ‘m’ carefully. It is missing.\r\n\r\n6. What is the rationale behind using $\\beta$ parameter 1.9 in the Levy function. What will be its impact on the stability of the distribution, in general the swarm optimization if we choose any other value, say 3 or 1.5?\r\n\r\n7. In Fig. 22,  it is quite unclear how pareto optimal solutions are  derived? The units are missing in the figure. “The solutions are highly distributed along both objectives thus proving both convergence and coverage of DSCCA in solving multi-objective constrained problem”, please explain further. What is the intuition behind this statement. As in my earlier comments, it is confusing how the term &#39;convergence&#39; is used in this manuscript.\r\n\r\n8. The authors should carefully check the manuscript to avoid any grammatical errors.\r\n\r\n9. In summary, though a very interesting approach, the dragonfly perspective for URLLC is still confusing to this reviewer in the absence of an explicit problem formulation. I suggest the authors to reconsider the title of this manuscript. Further, the paper is not so easy to follow because of its organization. I strongly encourage and suggest the authors to improve the organization and presentation of this paper.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- Reviewer 2\r\n\r\n  - This paper presents a novel nature inspired dragonfly based, optimization paradigm, named as dragonfly search convergence and coverage algorithm (DSCCA) for resource scheduling for ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) in an industrial wireless network. The authors makes a very detailed analysis and simulation works. \r\n\r\n \r\nBut I think it has something wrong for the basic concept or application: \r\n \r\n1) URLLC is a cellular technology, the communication is achieved between UEs and Base-stations. The authors consider the latency is guaranteed by the optimization for the relay node. \r\n2) The application background is about industrial wireless network, however, it cannot be distinguished from the introduction and model clearly.  \r\n3) URLLC is standardized for 1ms air latency and ms-level end-to-end latency, this paper optimized the routing and reduce the convergence rate. I think they are not the same kind of problems. \r\nAbove all, I strongly recommend the authors to change the background. I t  is   not   appropriate  only  to pursue   advanced   technology or concept, such as Industrial and 5G URLLC. The topic should be a reasonable story or application.", "write_date": "2020-01-22T11:08:14Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.134.90", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 256, "fields": {"subject": "Williams, Tactical Remodeling of Unrecoverable Data in MIL-STD-1553 Network for Industrial-IoBT&#34; to IEEE ICC 2020.", "content": "Dear Mr. Nwadiugwu Williams Paul Chukwuka,\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting your paper 1570601120 &#34;Tactical Remodeling of Unrecoverable Data in MIL-STD-1553 Network for Industrial-IoBT&#34; to IEEE ICC 2020.

Since re-transmission is still needed and it waits until the transmission of the next data packet, the proposed approach may not be able to reduce the latency. Besides, additional computations are needed to derive the approximate data and causes additional latency and computation overheads. \r\n\r\nFig. 4 and 5 shows the approximation accuracy.

The simulation results show that in comparison with other algorithms, the potential of proposed localization algorithm has better accuracy and requires slightly more time for computation. The topic is interesting but the following concerns should be addressed. \r\n1. The innovation and contribution of this work are limited. \r\n2. Introducing Wild Goats Algorithm (WGA) for range based wireless node localization in IWSN \r\nis not contribution of this work. \r\n3. Some parts such as both Abstract and Conclusion are redundantly phrased. \r\n4. The reviewer didn’t understand motivation of this work. What is motivation of this work? \r\n5. What is 2D on Page 3? \r\n6. The presentation quality of the manuscript needs to be improved. \r\n7. There are too many grammatical errors, which makes this paper very difficult to read. For \r\nexample:  1) On Page 1, all known distances between the unknown node and beacon nodes are \r\nassumed accurate. Accurate? 2) On Page 1, “Work in [4] proposed...” , “Work in [5] used...”, and “Work in [6] applies”. Tense should be consistent. 3) There is missing “,” in Eq.(16).\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\nComments to the Author\r\n\r\nThe authors introduced Wild Goats Algorithm (WGA) for range-based wireless node localization in IWSN. And made the simulation to show the proposed scheme has better performances than the other optimization methods. However, there are some problems that need to be discussed.\r\n1. WGA is just one kind of evolutionary algorithm, the authors should analyze why this method is better than others for range-based localization in terms of mechanism, rather than giving some simulation pictures.\r\n2. The authors gave Fig4-Fig7 simulation results, what is the meaning expressed from Fig4(a-e)? What do you want to tell to the readers from these pictures? How did the authors get these simulation results? There is no any analysis under each simulation outputs. Why the WGA is better than all the other methods except the computation time?\r\n3. If the authors gave a figure as Fig 3 to illustrate scenario 1, where is the figure to illustrate scenario 2?\r\n4. There is no such a program pseudocode in Page 4 expressed with all written words. It will be no difference with the Flow chart.\r\n5. If the authors illustrated the pseudocode, the illustrated flowchart is repetitive.\r\n6. There is lack of reference paper of the compared method: ABC (Artificial Bee Colony).\r\n7. What are the reasons to compare with ABC, CS, CSO, PSO? The authors should analyze all the characters of these methods including WGA.\r\n8. What is innovation of this article? There is no any improvement for the traditional WGA.\r\n9. There are too much introductions of common sense knowledge, such as:\r\n“The name originates from two words: ’meta’ and ’heuristic’.Heuristic means to discover or find, in a hit and miss manner. Meta is a prefix to a noun, specifying something of a higherlevel than the original noun”\r\nThe section of “B. Distance Measurement Methods”\r\n10. There are more sentences with inappropriate grammar or expressions, such as: “Low computation time is also important as in industrial environment there are many tasks need to be executed in time to maintain the timeliness in an industrial process.”; “The current ability of wireless technology industries to produce devices in almost all shape or size enables the application to be more targeted and efficient for any condition and environment.”; “in some cases, the initial system does not need to be modified.”; “using the distance between the unknown node and several beacon nodes, also the location of each beacon node.”; “Work in [4] proposed a modified version”;  “Work in [5] used a modified version”; “Given an IWSN consisting of sensor nodes, some know their locations while the others do not know”\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\nComments to the Author\r\n\r\nI have thoroughly read this paper many times with some implementation. I am an active researcher in this field and here are my few concerns.\r\n1. The idea is totally based on weight. A lot of other techniques like the most famous WCL is also based on this mechanism. So, what is your own contribution\r\n2. Noise, Rayleigh fading and the communication cost. nothing is taken into account in implementation of this idea.\r\n\r\nAE Comments: Reject\r\nAssociate Editor\r\nComments to the Author:\r\nThree reviewers have completed their review, and all three reviewers suggested that this paper does not satisfy the requirements of TII.

However, nor complexity analysis or comparison are mentioned in this paper, which make the motivation and advantages of this paper unconvinced.\r\n2.      The contribution of this paper is weak, since the dropout is a basic technique involved in deep learning.

The paper is well written.\r\n\r\nThis paper has a very limited contribution. Dropout is one of the very well known techniques for dealing with overfitting in neural networks. It is widely used while training neural networks by data scientists and researchers. I do not see any scientific contribution in adding dropout to a neural network.

The proposed deep learning framework is simply appling the exisitng well-known DNN to this scenario, including the dropout method which is also well-known.\r\n\r\n2. The feedback codebook design has been investigated intensively in the literature. The paper does not give any comparison with existing works.\r\n\r\n3. The codebook should be a discrete book.

We must therefore reject it.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your submitting your manuscript to this journal and for giving us the opportunity to consider your work.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nLaine Mears\r\nEditor-in-Chief\r\nManufacturing Letters", "write_date": "2020-02-03T14:43:22Z", "update_date": "2020-06-22T15:46:23Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 263, "fields": {"subject": "Williams, &#34;Experimental DF Joint-Relaying with MIMO-UWB for Wireless Underground Sensor Networks&#34;", "content": "09-Feb-2020\r\n\r\nWCL2019-1628\r\nExperimental DF Joint-Relaying with MIMO-UWB for Wireless Underground Sensor Networks\r\nBy: NWADIUGWU, WILLIAMS-PAUL; Kim, Dong-Sung\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Prof. Dong-Sung Kim:\r\n\r\nThe review of the referenced manuscript, WCL2019-1628, is now complete.

While the authors investigate an important problem, this paper suffers from serious problems.\r\n\r\n1- Some assumptions in the system model is not realistic. Since UAVs are floating in the air, obtaining the exact location of UAVs to use for the localization is not possible in most of the cases. For example, when the GPS is used for this, there is some error in the given location for UAVs. Furthermore, authors does not mention that how they obtain the exact location of UAVs. Furthermore, in realistic scenarios, ground users may have different altitudes. Therefore, the authors should solve the problem for 3D case.\r\n2- The proposed method is too heuristic. There is not any theoretical analysis to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. Thus, I believe that this paper may not be successful in opening new researches in this area.\r\n3- The authors have not provided convincing reasons to use neural network for the localization. In fact, there are a lot of researches on cooperative sensor network localization with rigorous theoretical analysis and their merits is proved through simulations. Authors does not discuss the superiority of using neural networks in comparison with these methods. In fact, the motivation behind using the neural network is not clear.\r\n4- Following the 3rd comment, I believe that the authors should compare their proposed method with other methods in the literature to show the effectiveness of their approach. For example, [14] is highly related to their work.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, unfortunately I recommend rejection.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nA WSN based node localization system using unmanned aerial vehicles and neural networks is proposed to reduce the required complexity.\r\nMy comments are as follows:\r\n1) It is strongly recommended to review the whole paper for grammatical and editorial typos.\r\n2) The figures are mostly explained after their appearance in the paper. For example, Figure 6 is on page 3, however, its explanation is come on page 4.\r\n3) In page 3 section A it is mentioned that: “The table of the saved RSSI values from one antenna of the UAV is shown in Fig. 5.” In previous section it was mentioned that UAV has two antennas and transmits the beacon from both antennas. Please eplaine how it transmits and receives at the same time from one antenna?\r\n4) Please explain how nodes with low transmit power have the ability to connect to UAV? The power consumption is important for both UAV and nodes. Considering the long distance between nodes and UAV, how the consumed power is managed?\r\n5) The novelty of the paper should be illustrated more clearly in the introduction section by comparing with other papers, such as:\r\n*Z. E. Khatab, A. Hajihoseini and S. A. Ghorashi, &#34;A Fingerprint Method for Indoor Localization Using Autoencoder Based Deep Extreme Learning Machine,&#34; in IEEE Sensors Letters, vol. 2, no. 1, pp. 1-4, March 2018, Art no. 6000204.\r\n**Hajihoseini Gazestani, A., Shahbazian, R. & Ghorashi, S.A.

Where did you use the ELM, present the mathematical equations of this.\r\n7) The scenario and its applications should be explained more clearly. Is the location of nodes is fixed? When the nodes know their location, is there any need to UAV? There are lot of questions about the details of the considered scenario that should be clearly explained.\r\n8) In training stage, how the received information is mapped to the location (x,y) of node? Is it a regression or classification problem?\r\n9) It is not enough to compare only with SVM and BP, other papers also should be seen and compared with.", "write_date": "2020-03-13T23:04:40Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.55", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 271, "fields": {"subject": "Cosmas Ifeanyi Nwakanma, Williams-Paul Nwadiugwu, Jae-Min Lee and Dong-Seong Kim &#34;Selecting Gaussian Process Regression Kernels for Evaluating MIMO-Antenna Configuration &#34;, ICEICE (Unsubmitted)", "content": "Dear Dr. Dong-Seong Kim, \r\n\r\n\r\nTemporary ID: 2020030300001 \r\nTitle: Selecting Gaussian Process Regression Kernels for Evaluating MIMO-Antenna Configuration \r\n\r\nThank you for your reply. \r\nWe cancelled your transaction of 2020030300001. \r\n\r\nLook forward to your future submission. \r\n\r\nKind regards, \r\n------------------------------------------------------------- \r\nIEICE Publishing Office \r\nKikai-Shinko-Kaikan Bldg., 3-5-8, \r\nShibakoen, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 105-0011, Japan \r\nPhone +81-3-3433-6692 Telefax +81-3-3433-6616", "write_date": "2020-03-20T12:06:52Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.61", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 272, "fields": {"subject": "Ali Aouto, Thien Huynh-The and  Dong-Seong Kim &#34;Gait Features Extraction Technique for Identity Detection Using CNN in Military Surveillance Systems&#34;", "content": "Comments from the editors and reviewers:\r\n-Reviewer 1\r\n\r\n  -\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nThis paper proposes an identification system, which can train a sequence of gaits to recognize a person using a pre-trained CNN model. Especially, in order to recognize the unique sequence of gaits which a person has, the model of the proposed system leverages the orientation and distance of joints extracted from 3D skeleton information. Based on this gait-identification model, this paper evaluates the system on four different pre-trained models and 150 sequences collected from 30 participants (UPCV) dataset.\r\n\r\nReview\r\n\r\nOverall, this paper introduces the gait-based identification system to overcome existing identification methods based on appearance features such as the face, fingerprint, etc. Through several references related to the existing works, this approach is enough to assert the necessity of the proposed system. But, I think that the other parts in this paper leave much to be desired. For this reason, this shortcoming also makes the contributions of this paper unclear. So, I&#39;m worried about the following points.\r\n\r\n    Intro:\r\n\r\n     -This section is now trying to deliver too much information including introduction, motivation, and related work. These parts can be shorten to address system design and contribution clearly.\r\n\r\n    Scheme:\r\n\r\n     -The mathematical symbols in the proposed scheme are not predefined. This makes the flow of mathematical equations hard to understand.\r\n\r\n      --- Why does the equation, &#39;h(h-1)&#39;, represent the amount of distance and orientation values? And please describe the detail information about &#39;h&#39;.\r\n\r\n     -The proposed model is based on a pre-trained deep learning model. However, a series of these processes related to getting illustrative statistics characteristics are designed to make the dataset as an input for the deep model. These processes seem to make the deep learning model meaningless.\r\n\r\n    -There is no reasonable explanation of why the model pre-trained by image dataset was used. Also, rather than writing unnecessary equations, I recommend the authors need to address how to modify the model.\r\n\r\n    Evaluation:\r\n\r\n    -Data collected from subjects is usually cross-validated by splitting subjects rather than by splitting data. I think the authors should include an additional description of this part.\r\n\r\n    -In order to recognize a particular person, it seems that this system must have that person&#39;s gait information. Unlike what this paper claims, how is it possible to identify strangers who are not included in the training dataset?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-  Need to reorganize the list of the equations including a symbol table\r\n-  Need to define what are contributions to this paper\r\n-  Lack of details and discussions\r\n+ Motivation and Not bad performance\r\n\r\n\r\n-Reviewer 2\r\n\r\n  -\r\nThis paper proposes a gait-based user identification system. More specifically, the authors introduce a posture-based approach that uses geometric attributes (e.g., distances and orientations between joints) collected when users are walking. As a tool for identifying users based on the attributes, pre-trained CNN models are slightly modified for suiting the purpose of this work. The experiment result with the UPCV dataset shows a high degree of accuracy.\r\n\r\nPros\r\n- The motivation is strong.\r\n- The technical design, especially feature extraction, was described in detail, which was very informative.\r\nevaluated and reported in detail.\r\n\r\nCons\r\n1. The authors use pre-defined CNN models with slight modifications. But, details for this transfer learning process are not explained well. For example, in the transfer learning, we need to decide which parts (layers) will be re-trained with a new dataset. We can select some lower-level layers in a convolution base or only classification layers. It is unclear how the authors fine-tuned the pre-trained models.\r\n\r\n2. The proposed system was evaluated with the UPCV gait dataset collected in controlled environments (during collecting data, users walk a straight line with a normal speed). However, in practice, there are several issues that cause a decrease in the quality of data (e.g., some joints are missed). I&#39;m curious the performance of this system in realistic environments. \r\n\r\n3. When reporting the evaluation results, could you compare the results with those from existing works (e.g., aspect-based approaches).\r\n\r\n4. There are some major typos and grammar issues throughout the paper\r\n\r\nOverall, I like the idea and design in this paper. However, there are some issues that prevents it to be published at this stage. Therefore, I encourage the authors to improve the paper and resubmit.", "write_date": "2020-03-25T15:09:52Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.134.82", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 273, "fields": {"subject": "Real-time Optimizations in Energy Profiles and End-to-End Delay In WSN for IoT Applications", "content": "Reviewer: 1\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Reject (Paper is not acceptable for the Sensors Journal.

The paper is well-structured and well-written. But, some comments should be addressed to improve the quality of the paper.\r\n\r\n1. Proper reference should be provided fopr the benchmark problems selected in the paper and it should be described the reason of choosing this set of benchmark problems.\r\n2. The literature should be modified to show the impact of recent metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as: A novel random walk grey wolf optimizer, A hybrid self-adaptive sine cosine algorithm with opposition based learning, Improved sine cosine algorithm with crossover scheme for global optimization, A novel hybrid sine cosine algorithm for global optimization and its application to train multilayer perceptrons, Cauchy Grey Wolf Optimiser for continuous optimisation problems, Harmonized salp chain-built optimization.\r\n3. It will be better to represent the results on benchmark for only two decimal places.\r\n4. A statistical test should be done in the paper to represent the significance improvement in the results.\r\n5. Why, only some selected test problems are reported in the paper of CEC 2014.

The reviewers agree that the topic is interesting, however, the work lacks novelty. They also identify several technical issues with this work including lack of validation and evaluation, comparison with state-of-the art, and weaknesses in the results and analysis.\r\n\r\n&#8226; Reviewer Comments, if any, are listed below:\r\n\r\nReviewer: 1\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe authors consider a two-tier edge-IoT network, where IoT devices are at the first level and the edge nodes are at the second level.\r\nIn the 1st tier, the authors proposed using an algorithm for clustering and selecting the cluster head, which is response for data compression and offload the data to the edge node.\r\nIn the 2nd tier, a CNN model is deployed to work on the sensitivity level of the uploaded data.\r\nThe authors conducted the experimental results using the ns-3.26 simulator and it is shown that the proposed approach is superior to all the existing ones.\r\n\r\nAlthough the topic considered in this work is interesting and timely, there are some major comments and concerns, which the authors should take care to further improve their work. Please check the list below for more detail.\r\n\r\n1. It is stated in the introduction that &#34;the existing clustering and routing algorithms have higher complexity even for a slight improvement in energy efficiency&#34;; however, it is not clear to the reviewer.\r\nThe authors should mention clearly why the state of the arts have high complexity and how about when compared with your proposed algorithm in this work.\r\n\r\n2. The motivation part is not clear to the reviewer. More importantly, I cannot see any novelty of this work and differences with the state-of-the-arts. The authors are suggested to significantly rewrite the introduction part and emphasize their contributions, and features and advantages of their work. Further, Section II (Related Works) should be written in the way to support the main idea of this work; otherwise, this section is meaningless.\r\n\r\n3. What is exactly denoted by criteria in &#34;The M Score is a combination of significant criteria&#34;. This part should be made clear; otherwise, the readers may have to guess what is criteria and how to combine them to create a unique metric for performing the clustering head selection strategy.\r\n\r\n4. In Section II-B, the sentence &#34;These works also focused on offloading the data processing task to the edge deviceshowever, they were unable to achieve energy efficiency among the IoT nodes&#34; seems to be not correct. Lots of research works on Edge-IoT focus on improving the energy efficiency of end devices. They key point here is enabling the offloading from end IoT devices to the edge nodes, thus saving energy and improving the completion time.\r\n\r\n5. The title of Section III is Problem Formulation, which is therefore expected to show some mathematical problem formulations instead of writing some paragraphs on the related works. I am not sure what is the purpose of this section since it seems to be duplicated from Section II and in part from Section I, where the authors present the main focus and contribution of this work.\r\n\r\n6. Regarding the proposed approach, the reviewer has the following concerns:\r\n6.1. the concept &#34;Voronoi Cell-based Correlation Cluster Formation&#34; and related terms like Voronoi is new to the reviewer and may be most readers. The authors should show the originality of this concept.\r\n\r\n6.2. It is stated that a fully connected CNN model is proposed and deployed at the edge node to compress the data uploaded from the IoT devices. However, the reviewer cannot find the proposed model in the manuscript. Figure 3 shows a neural network model with the output of compressed data, but it is not mentioned at any point in the manuscript and the novelty of the proposed model is not showed and explained clearly.\r\n\r\n6.3. In Section I, the authors noted that the existing clustering and cluster head selection algorithms have high complexity and at this point, the reviewer do think that the approach proposed in this work is a light scheme. But I cannot find any analysis for the computational and time complexity of the proposed approach. The authors should double-check this point.\r\n\r\n7. All the figures are of low quality. The authors should use vector images instead of bitmap ones. More, some figures are not formally presented, e.g., Figure 4 (Simulation results of the proposed model) can be removed without any effect on the paper quality. Showing all what you have done is not a good way when doing a research work, instead the authors should merely show their novelty and contributions compared with the state of the arts.\r\n\r\n8. Regarding the simulation results, there are some concerns:\r\n8.1. There are some abnormal points in the simulation results. For example, in Figure 7, the trend is higher PDR when the number of IoT nodes increase, but the PDR of K-S Statistics with 30 IoT nodes does not follow this trend. Another example can be found in Figure 9.\r\nIt seems that the plot is achieve using a single-shot network setting. If it is a case, the authors should check the Monte-Carlo simulation.\r\n\r\n8.2. The proposed approach is able to achieve better result than all the existing schemes in terms of throughput, energy efficiency, reliability, delay, and PDR. As far as the reviewer knows, there is a tradeoff between the throughput and energy consumption, same thing observes for other metrics. If you want to achieve something, you must to pay something, all is almost difficult to achieve simultaneously.\r\n\r\n8.3. The authors are recommended to compared their proposed approach with the optimal solution as well as non-learning schemes. It would better verify the effectiveness of their proposed algorithm.\r\n\r\n8.4. The experimental results should be validated with more numbers of IoT devices. This would be useful to apply the scheme proposed in this work for massive connectivity in IoT networks.\r\n\r\n9. Minor comments\r\n- Although the manuscript is almost accessible, the authors are still recommended to proofread their work since there are some typo and grammatical errors.\r\n- The references should be formatted in a consistent way.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper discusses an approach using 5 methods namely, cell-based cluster formation, multipart CH selection, redundant data elimination, optimal routing and ML-based data compression, to achieve energy efficiency in an IoT network. This method have been compared with 3 state-of-the-art methods and shown to have better performance in terms of energy, throughput and reliability.\r\nThere are a few points that the authors need to address in the paper.\r\n“Sensitivity level” of the data speaks of a sensitivity range but it turns out you were making a binary choice of whether the data is sensitive or not.\r\nData Validation by Threshold Value DVTV): How is this threshold determined at the edge node and how does it relate to the sensitivity of the data?\r\n\r\n“Thus, the non-sensitive data needs to be compressed which results in better performance.” &#8211; Better performance of what?\r\n\r\nThe F2CNN is fast and has the following layers:\r\nAnd in the hidden layers there is “the proposed F2CNN-LZW”. It is not clear which architecture you are explaining in this\r\n\r\n“The LZW technique uses the code-book for data compression”…What is the codebook being referred to here?\r\n\r\nFor data compression, a novel F2CNN-LZW lossless compression technique is presented…Please explain what is the novelty in this technique that justifies the novelty claim. Also justify why ‘novel’ is claimed for the GR-SimRank scheme and two-tier architecture.\r\n\r\nEquation 18 and 19 does not make much sense. What is ‘O’ in (18) and why do you have two different equations for determining the output. Is (19) really an equation to determine the output or it is the output (compressed data) itself?\r\n\r\nWhat does ‘ fast’ mean for the F2CNN model and how is this measured and achieved?\r\n\r\nHow was the F2CNN-LZW network trained and with which datasets? Did you consider the complexity of the training and deployment? Part of the problem statement of the paper is that achieving energy efficiency is restricted by complex compression method. Neural networks introduce their complexity, and since this is employed for data compression, it would be useful to see, in your analysis and results, how this particular network has mitigated the issue of complex compression. There is a claim that with this method ‘all data packets are processed in parallel and compressed rapidly’ but this is not substantiated in the result section. Also, how does this compression technique contribute to improving energy efficiency?\r\n\r\nFig. 1: If you can make it clearer with the arrows or numbering the stages of the algorithms if they are happening sequentially. For F2CNN-LZW, shouldn’t the output be non-sensitive compressed data? But the arrow instead points to the sensitive data.\r\n\r\nTable 3: What is the difference between data reduction and compression. You should make it clear what the definition of these two is, as they are sometimes used interchangeably. Compression is sometimes referred to as a data reduction technique.\r\n\r\n\r\nComparative analysis (Energy consumption):\r\n\r\nYou claim that the major reason for lower energy consumption is because the model ‘uses edge computing to offload the data processing from the IoT nodes.’\r\nWhat is not clear is the contribution of each of the 5 methods in lowering energy consumption. What specific data processing tasks do the edge offload from the IoT nodes?\r\n\r\nIt is not very clear how the energy consumption in this paper is measured and how this fairly compares to the three state-of-the-art methods. Did you measure only energy consumption at the IoT nodes alone or among all the nodes in the entire network? If energy consumption in IoT nodes alone are measured, what is the essence of the data compression technique and its contribution to the overall objective of improving energy efficiency?\r\n\r\nAs the 5 methods are claimed to contribute to energy efficiency, a discussion of how each of these methods have individually contributed to improving the energy efficiency of the system is missing. This will further justify their use in addition to the already shown aggregated contribution to the system.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper addresses a potentially interesting topic, well suited to the expected readers&#39; audience, even if of not outstanding technical originality. While energy management in edge-enable-IoT is still a largely unexplored area, the presented solution is mainly a variant of the more traditional problem of route design, and compression method.\r\nAnyway, I have several major concerns with the submitted paper:\r\n1) Most relevant, the technical content and contribution of the paper are too limited for a high-quality IEEE Journal. The paper does not present at all the design, implementation, deployment, optimization, and evaluation work made on a real prototype of the proposed solution. The targeted research area is already relatively mature; it is not sufficient to propose an algorithm (which is a variation of existing solutions in the literature).\r\n2) No validation and assessment of the reported simulation results with measurements from in-the-field deployment experiences, of course in simplified execution environments and topologies\r\n3) No lessons learned from direct implementation and experimentation of a real prototype\r\n4) The results have no comparison of the complexity analysis of the proposed algorithm with existing approaches. Since computation overhead is an important metric to evaluate the algorithm, the authors should add such a result.\r\n5) While energy is a crucial metric indicators in edge-enable-IoT environment. However, the author did not mention what kind of energy model used in this work. The Authors should have clarified better and more explicitly how energy considerations apply only on the subset IoT node in the edge-enable-IoT environment. Given that the consideration energy is one of the few significant aspects of technical originality of the proposal, this weakness is not negligible\r\n6) Be specific in the Abstract (1st half) in the problem of literature that has been addressed in this work.  Make sure that all paragraphs length does not exceed 25 lines. In the 4th paragraph of the introduction section, it needs relevant recent literature for novelty verification with the recent 3 years existing works in the domain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 4\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\n1) The motivation of this paper should be discussed in detail.  \r\n2) The result section is very poor. Please revise the section with some new results.  \r\n3) The contributions of this paper are somehow novel, please explain it in detail.  \r\n4) The related work section should be updated.  \r\n5) There are some grammatical mistakes and typos, please revise the paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: If any of the reviews include an additional attached file, it will not be attached to this message.

The proposed framework is evaluated by a statistical analysis-based approach by adopting various statistical analysis methods and comparing them among each other in terms of the efficiency of the proposed framework.\r\n1. The paper is overall well-written and the proposed analysis is easy to follow.\r\n2. The paper is rich in terms of numerical results and evaluation of the pure proposed framework.\r\n3. There are several other methods that have been proposed in the literature to deal with multi-objective optimization problems, either based on game theory, e.g., Tsiropoulou, E.E., P. Vamvakas, and S. Papavassiliou. &#34;Joint utility-based uplink power and rate allocation in wireless networks: A non-cooperative game theoretic framework.&#34; Physical Communication 9 (2013): 299-307, or based on optimization techniques, e.g., M.R. Musku, A.T. Chronopoulos, D.C. Popescu, A. Stefanescu, A game-theoretic approach to joint rate and power control for uplink CDMA communications, IEEE Transactions on Communications 58 (3) (2010) 923-932. Those techniques keep the individual characteristics of the nodes in the wireless network. The authors should clarify their contribution compared to such types of approaches, as the manuscript considers swarms of nodes.\r\n4. The wireless communication model that is adopted is not described in the paper. The authors should at least refer to similar communication models, e.g., Singhal, Chetna, and Swades De, eds. Resource allocation in next-generation broadband wireless access networks. IGI Global, 2017, if they want to save some space in their manuscript and focus on the proposed algorithmic approach.\r\n5. The paper provides detailed numerical results regarding the operation of the proposed algorithm by evaluating it with different statistical models. However, the authors should show the benefits of this approach as compared to others proposed in the literature dealing with multi-objective resource management.\r\n6. The authors should provide some discussion regarding the computational complexity and real-execution time of the proposed framework that makes it a candidate for adoption in realistic industrial wireless networks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #2: First and foremost, I would strongly suggest the authors to be careful (very) about addressing to the reviewers comments, &#34;we thank the reviewer for &#39;his&#39; comments&#34; must be changed to &#34;her/his&#34; or  &#34;his/her&#34;. However, this has not affected the review decision, which was based solely on the merits of authors&#39; response.\r\n\r\nThe authors have fairly responded to my earlier comments. However, the manuscript still has some confusing aspects  that needs to be addressed in order to improve its quality. Please check the following comments:\r\n1- The formulation for latency is not proper. (see (5) and (6), and  the use of \\min). Also, the model needs further description on resource allocation using proposed multi-objective optimization solution.\r\n2- In (11), it should be \\gamma_k and \\alpha_{k = 1} instead of &#39;i&#39;.\r\n3- Similarly, (12) is not a properly defined. The index (1) in \\gamma_k has some meaning? Is  \\epsilon a typo there? Does the authors mean \\alpha in RA? But, is RA defined as set before? This portion is very confusion. I suggest the authors to carefully check the formulations.\r\n4- The throughput objective function (9) is not a set. Please check the use of \\{\\ } everywhere.\r\n5-  I think connectivity functionalities (C_f) needs further explanation.\r\n6-  How quantification error is defined?\r\n7- The manuscript requires further proofreading  to improve readability. In this regard, the used notations and definitions can be significantly improved.\r\n8- Some changes like below can be done:\r\n       - i.e -> i.e.,\r\n       - for roman text use \\textrm{}, \\max, \\min", "write_date": "2020-05-06T15:35:55Z", "update_date": "2020-05-06T15:57:35Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 291, "fields": {"subject": "Edge Computational Task Offloading Scheme using Reinforcement Learning for IIoT Scenario", "content": "Dear Mr Hossain,\r\nYou have been listed as a co-author of the following submission:\r\nSubmission no: ICTE_2020_165\r\nSubmission title: Edge Computational Task Offloading Scheme using Reinforcement Learning for IIoT Scenario\r\nCorresponding author: Professor Dong-Seong Kim\r\n\r\nWe are writing to let you know the status of this submission has changed to Revision Requested.

Pack\r\nEditor\r\nICT Express\r\nComments from the editors and reviewers:\r\n-Reviewer 1\r\n\r\n  - This paper proposed the offloading framework which determines the task offloading and resource allocation.\r\n\r\nI have some questions.\r\n1. Which entity determines the task offloading and resource allocation policy?. I think that since the end device cannot determine the decisions, the controller which determines the decisions is needed.\r\nPlease, clarify the system model and the overall procedure. In my opinion, the delay model should be re-defined if the controller is added.\r\n\r\n2. According to constraints(14a), alpha_n can be set to one or zero. But according to (14c), alpha_n should be less than F. What is F ? and since if F is set a value less than 1 all alpha_n should be determined as 0, F should be set over 1. Anyway, how (14c) can represent &#34;the edge servers resource constraint&#34;? I cannot understand constraint. Please, clarify these constraints and description.\r\n\r\n3. State, action, reward should be formulated to use Q-Learning. What is reward? Please, clarify the Q-learning formulation. In my opinion, it is better to reduce the description of basic Q-learning and add the description of proposed Q-learning based offloading scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this paper, there are many type errors and inconsistent definition.\r\nFor instance, \r\n1. in Related Work Section, rea time data streaming (in the first stance) should be corrected as real time~.\r\n2. in 3.1 System Model, the authors wrote: &#34;The user equipment (UE) set is stand for N = 1, 2, 3,..., N&#34;. Is this definition correct?. I think that The UE set will be defined as N \\in {1,2,3, ..., n, ..., N_max}.\r\n3. on page 3, alpha_n = 0 means the end device n offload task to edge server, but on page 4, alpha_n = 0 means that n end device executes its task by local computing. Why the definition of alpha is different?\r\n4. &#34;n end devices&#34; was written. Is this correct term? &#34;n end devices&#34; means the number of devices is &#34;n&#34;\r\nBesides these, there are many incorrect definitions. The author should revise the paper by considering these problems.\r\n\r\n-Reviewer 2\r\n\r\n  - \r\nThe authors examined the scheme fo a task offloading approach for the edge devices considering IIoT networks with computing resources at the end devices. \r\nThe paper is very well written and has provided a list of up-to-date references. The paper is interesting and well organized. However, this paper is needed to revise/update some parts.\r\nPlease shows recall traces outperform \r\nPlease explain how the use of a backtracking model and recall traces\r\nPlease shows proposed model as compared model with Average reward vs. timesteps\r\nPlease explain what a good table means in Figure 4\r\nPlease explain simulation environment", "write_date": "2020-05-11T16:53:46Z", "update_date": "2020-05-11T22:01:27Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 292, "fields": {"subject": "Super-Resolution for CSI Reconstruction Based on Improved Autoencoder in Massive MIMO Communication System", "content": "18-May-2020\r\n\r\nDear Prof. Jae-Min Lee,\r\n\r\nI am writing to you in regards to manuscript # SPL-28276-2020 entitled &#34;Super-Resolution for CSI Reconstruction Based on Improved Autoencoder in Massive MIMO Communication System&#34;, which you submitted to the IEEE Signal Processing Letters.\r\nThe submitted manuscript was reviewed by our editorial board to determine whether it meets the standards of this journal in terms of scope, presentation and technical depth. Please note that only the submissions which pass the preliminary review are scheduled for a full peer review. Regretfully, the review concluded that the paper is not suitable for publication in IEEE Signal Processing Letters due to poor quality of writing in English. This means that the prescreening found frequent grammatical mistakes and odd sentence constructions, which automatically exclude the paper from consideration.\r\nNote that while this is the primary reason for the recommendation, the prescreening may have found other deficiencies.\r\nSome specific comments from the editorial board members are below:\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nOverall this paper is poorly written and there are lots of grammatical and format issues. Please be aware that IEEE Signal Processing Letters is highly selective and our decision is binary. As a consequence, from the viewpoint of grammar and English usage, it is necessary for submissions to be publishable, or very nearly so, at the time of initial submission.\r\n\r\nSome additional comments: This paper investigates a super-resolution technique to reconstruct the channel state information (CSI) based on an improved autoencoder in the massive MIMO communication system. In general, the contribution is not clear. It seems that this work simply combines the super-resolution and dropout techniques for the considered problem. In addition, the numerical results are not practical. Only 32 base station antennas are considered, which is small for a massive MIMO system.\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nPlease note that according to IEEE Signal Processing Society policy 6.16 &#34;Handling of Rejected Papers&#34; (https://signalprocessingsociety.org/volunteers/policy-and-procedures-manual), the Society strongly discourages resubmission of rejected manuscripts more than once. Authors should carefully review the aforementioned policy before resubmitting their manuscript.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering the IEEE Signal Processing Letters for the publication of your research.

In particular, they investigate the use of a C-RAN network of small cell base stations with limited fronthaul capacity. \r\nThe topic is relevant and timely, and the introduction of the paper describes it quite well. However, in my opinion, the quality of the paper is insufficient for journal publication. More importantly, I think the technical contribution lacks novelty and awareness of the state-of-the-art.\r\n\r\nOn page 4 of the Introduction the authors present a bullet-list of the novel contributions claimed in this manuscript. However, as far as I can tell, all four bullet points describe well-established and extensively researched problems in the wireless communication domain:\r\n1) Instead of using a conventional cellular network, a C-RAN is used. Are the authors claiming the invention of C-RAN?\r\n2) Instead of using base stations with backhaul, fronthaul is used. Again, the authors simply describe a well-known feature of C-RAN. \r\n3) Beamforming - again, an extensively studied technique (and already operating in the real world) for cellular networks.\r\n4) Each user is served by many APs. Again, although this is a more cutting edge topic, Coordinated Multi-Point, PHY layer network coding, distributed antenna systems all aim to address this challenge, so I was not sure how this contribution stands out from the state-of-the-art.\r\n\r\nThe performance evaluation section is also insufficient and poorly written. For example, page 14: &#34;The power amplifier efficiency μ is set to 2.4. The simulation results were conducted under MATLAB R20186a environment, running on an Intel Core i3-7100 3.90 GHz CPU with RAM of 8Gb.&#34; What does an efficiency greater than 1 mean? What MATLAB version is it? The RAM is 8 GB, not Gb, I am guessing? This is a minor point, but it reflects the overall quality of the manuscript.\r\n\r\nThe comparison with just a &#34;conventional heterogeneous cellular network&#34; does not look credible to me, as there is a myriad of proposed protocols and schemes for HetNets, including those focusing on the energy efficiency, so the authors would need to compare the performance with some of those.\r\n\r\nReviewer #2: \r\n\r\nFrom the reviewer&#39;s aspect, the current manuscript suffers from severe deficiencies. The presentation of the paper could be heavily improved. There are so many grammatical errors and typos throughout the paper, e.g., incorrect use of &#34;a/an&#34;, &#34;the&#34; and wrong spellings. Also, abbreviations such as AP, CHCN and MIMO need to be used clearly throughout the paper. For details, please refer to the following:\r\n\r\n1The system model has not been addressed properly. For example, &#34;L&#34; represents the number of users in pager 5, but in page 13, it is the number of AP. Also, &#34;P&#34; is the number of channels, but what is &#34;P users&#34; in page 12?\r\n2. In System model, it is not clear to see how the system is modelled in terms of multiple antennas or single antenna for the users. The authors considered single antenna for the users in the system model, but massive MIMO (which may use multiple antennas for the users) is considered for the simulation. In this context, it is not clearly described why and how many antennas are considered for the small cell BSs and APs to employ massive MIMO.\r\n3.

It is judged that this paper is about how to connect and set up devices. It is a natural methodology to have a redundancy structure in a network configuration using a switch, and there can be many structures and a number of configuration cases for this. I think that it is not possible to give a meaning as a thesis for one of these cases. If you want to get the value of the thesis, it is not a structure and a setting, but a problem that can occur in this structure, and this problem has been studied in existing studies (presenting the latest article), and there is a methodology differentiated from them in this article. Should be presented.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer 2:\r\n1) Since the redundancy itself, which is easily predicted to improve performance due to redundancy, is the main focus of the paper, the specific suggestions or contributions of this paper are not clear.\r\n\r\n2) It is necessary to clearly describe whether only SW or HW was used for performance evaluation, and used HW, SW, and traffic.\r\n\r\n3) Since most of the references are previous papers such as 2010 and 2012, it is necessary to add references that reflect recent research trends.", "write_date": "2020-06-01T15:10:45Z", "update_date": "2020-06-12T16:40:53Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 297, "fields": {"subject": "Energy-Aware Two-Tier Model For Edge-assisted IoT using CNN", "content": "Reviewer 1\t\t\r\nIn this work, the relay aided end-to-end delay optimization in wireless sensor network has been addressed. A routing table creation algorithm was proposed. My major concerns fall into the following aspects.\r\n\r\nIn the introduction and related work section, the motivation has not been clearly presented. In the related work section, too many words for existing works, on what they have done and their drawbacks. However, the drawbacks that could motivate this paper has not clearly identified. For example, they mentioned that &#39;However, during the communication process, there is a trade-o&#64256; between the data packet size and the transmission power&#39;, but there have been many works addresses the same issue that includes trade-off between data packet size and transmission power which leads to optimal power allocation schemes. The new contributions thus are unclear.\r\n\r\nIn wireless sensor networks, the sensor nodes should be coordinated. In this work, the algorithm seems a distributed implementation. However, if multiple relay nodes obtain the same message, how could de-duplication scheme work? Because by reducing the repeated message transmission, energy can be saved, but link connectivity may suffer. Therefore, there should be trade-off between link connectivity and energy consumption. In this work, the end-to-end delay acts as the main targets, which may be impractical.\r\n\r\nThe convergence of proposed scheme should be addressed because of the distributed implementation. \r\n\r\nFor the network or system model, interferences may happen during transmission. For example, are the sensor nodes full duplex? If they are half duplex, interferences can happen, how can you manage this?\r\n\r\nThere have been numerous studies on the same issue with real-world experiments. Authors are encouraged to construct a testbed to verify the proposed scheme. \r\n\r\nWhat is the controlling overhead in such a network system?\r\n\r\nIn the simulation, sensor nodes&#39; number is fixed. However, when there are thousands of sensor nodes, can the system still work? When nodes are close to each other, interferences can be very strong. How can you manage this? In this case, the base station should be introduced to coordinate all the sensor noes. Therefore, it is recommended to amend the network model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\nReviewer 2\t\t\r\nPaper summary\r\nThis paper proposes a routing protocol to enhance the delay and energy efficiency in WSN for IoT applications. The proposed scheme introduces a novel potential relay information (PRI) metric function which is used to measure the routing potential of nodes. Two-hop information is used to enable nodes to view down their routing path and make better forwarding decisions in real-time to boosts the system performance. The performance is evaluated by simulating.\r\n\r\nMy suggestions for this work are as follows.\r\n\r\n1. Fonts are different in some figures and tables. Please unify the font in this paper. There should be &#34;,&#34; after an equation, and &#34;Where&#34; should be &#34;where&#34;. \r\n2. What is the limitation of existing methods? It is not presented clearly in Section I.\r\n3. In GreenOrbs,  thousands of sensors are deployed in the real environment. There must be a method to deal with the similar problems proposed in this paper. So what is the difference between this paper and the approaches proposed in the other works? What are the advantages of this paper?\r\n4. Why two-hop is studied in this paper, not multi-hop?\r\n5. In the evaluation part, the work [35] RTLD was published in 2008. Why the author chooses this paper to compare with the method proposed in this paper?\r\n6. More than half of the references in this paper are too old. It is better to reference the state of arts published in recent 5 years. Please reference the following two papers.

We have received feedback on your manuscript from two experts. Both have expressed concerns on the novelty and the nature of technical evaluation to validate the performance of the proposed methods. Some important comments include\r\n\r\n1. Lack of novelty since the framework of using LSTM ideas to compute missing data is well known. Reviewer 2 thinks that presenting the accuracy and computation time of these methods are rather shallow, instead, suggests to analyze the trade-off between accuracy and computation time in a rigorous manner, and also address problem statements that capitalize the existence of LSTM schemes to schedule infrequent updates of data from the sensors so as to increase energy-efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Claim on computational efficiency of DL methods is not well supported owing to the use high end GPUs, which may not go well with real time data recovery applications. Furthermore, Reviewer 1 thinks that complexity of the training process must also be discussed, and also should consider relevant baselines such as SOTA and other deep learning methods instead of using SARIMAX, which can not utilize future data for inferring past missing data points.\r\n\r\nBased on the above comments, and my own reading of the manuscript, I am unable to recommend this manuscript for publication in IEEE Wireless Communication Letters.\r\n\r\nThe reviewers&#39; comments are found at the end of this email.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting your work to the IEEE Wireless Communications Letters. I hope the outcome of this specific submission will not discourage you from the submission of future manuscripts.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDr. J Harshan\r\nEditor, IEEE Wireless Communications Letters\r\njharshan@gmail.com\r\n\r\nReviewer: 1\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nIn this paper, the authors presented an algorithm to recover missing data from sensors in real-time. Their main contribution is the use of biLSTM by incorporating future observations so as to recover the missing data points. While the approach is meaningful, I don&#39;t find it novel enough for IEEE WCL. Below are some of the major issues I found with this paper:\r\n1) I find it hard to believe that DL in comparison to classical deterministic approaches is computationally efficient. The authors use Nvidia RTX 2070 which is a high end GPU and doesn&#39;t support the point that authors want to convey in terms of real time data recovery. However, they show superior performance in the evaluation section which again only includes SARIMAX. Authors should include comparison with SOTA and other deep learning/machine learning based approaches.\r\n2) Also, since SARIMAX can not utilize future data for inferring past missing data points, in a way, it might be an unfair comparison. Authors should include a comparison with methods that utilize (or can utilize) future data points or, clearly mention that they are the first ones doing so which might not be the case anyway.\r\n2) The paper doesn&#39;t clearly describe the training of LSTM/biLSTM architectures. Note that this will also add to the runtime of their method. One can argue that training has to be performed only once (which is probably what this paper is doing as mentioned in the evaluation section) but that is typically why Neural Networks are not very computationally efficient. I still expect the authors to compare the training time and then argue that we don’t train the model anymore and only utilize it for inference.\r\n3) The paper is not written clearly and there are minor typos. I believe that LSTM equations, since they are not proposed by the authors, can be taken out and the original paper can be cited here instead. Similarly biLSTM should also be cited since it is not the contribution in this paper.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, authors should rethink whether their main contribution is better runtime or improved performance (as shown in the evaluation section). A more important problem would be where the sensor data doesn’t come from a fixed distribution and the model has to be updated which is more practical from my point of view. However, in this case, training has to be done more carefully keeping in mind the increase in runtime.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as of now, this paper is not a good fit for IEEE WCL in my opinion.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper uses an LSTM (Bi-LSTM) framework for filling the missing values in a time series data. The following are the comments:\r\n\r\n1. The paper lacks novelty as it is well known that LSTM (and its variants) work well on time series data. The framework is well studied, and can be implemented pretty easily\r\n(lot of online resources are available).\r\n\r\n2. Although the performance in terms of accuracy is better in LSTM and Bi-LSTM compared to SARIMAX, they seem to have higher compute time. The authors do not comment on the trade-off that may exists between compute time and accuracy. The insights provided by the study is not clear.\r\n\r\n3. An interesting problem would be to study when the sensors should send data. For example, if the next value can be easily predictable, the sensor need not burn energy to send the data.\r\n\r\n4. In the experiments (related to weather), they seem to consider only three features. What is the rationale behind this?\r\n\r\n5. There are several notations that are undefined. For example, \\sigma_c and \\sigma_h are undefined (they define \\sigma which is never used). There are several errors in the paper. For example, &#34;performance component analysis (PCA)&#34; in line 18, page 2. There are several such errors.

I recommend the paper for rejection.\r\n\r\nComments follow:\r\n\r\n1) In Sec. I, 2nd paragraph, I recommend to clarify the explanation of the two major challenges.\r\n\r\n2) In Sec. I, 3rd paragraph, the sentence “The machine learning method is intended to learn better feature representations from a vast number of unlabeled data, and then add these learned features to the classification.” is misleading. Authors are losing a layer: difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches. Authors seem to refer to unsupervised machine learning approaches, but the techniques used in the work are supervised.\r\n\r\n3) I stress the lack of a Related Works section. The comparison of the proposal with the existing literature on the topic is necessary to enhance the contribution provided by the authors.\r\n\r\n4) In Sec. IV B, 5th paragraph, the sentence “Results indicate that the time needed for the system to detect anomaly doing feature selection is faster than the process with feature selection.” is misleading.\r\n\r\n5) The results are far from novel.\r\n\r\n6) As SFS is the contribution, I recommend a comparison with other feature selection algorithms to verify the effectiveness of the proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper is interesting, it has achieved better performance on baseline classifiers with the help of Sequential Forward feature selection algorithm.\r\nIs the sub-category list of network intrusion an exhaustive list?\r\nIs it possible to mention how this compares with other feature selection algorithms applied to NIDS?\r\nIs there any reason why the training set was chosen at 10%? If the training set percentage is changed, does the performance of the Feature selection algorithm change?\r\nThe definitions in Table 1, about the categories of attack, are a little confusing at places. For example, &#34;Through transmitting data packet to that device,\r\nthe attacker receives remotely unwanted access to\r\na computer machine over a network&#34;.

In addition, Tables I, II, and III are well-known, could be easily referenced to other papers than describing here again. Especially when authors DO NOT clarify if they are performing a 2-class or 5-class classification. It seems that this is a 2-class classification ONLY which is anyways expected to give better results. Similarly, both figures 1 and 3, ND Algorithm 1 are totally unnecessary. Instead, authors should focus on the discussion of related work and clarifying why 5-classes have been discussed when their proposed work simply classifies the data in attack and normal categories.\r\n\r\nThis paper lacks comparison to their results with popular works. E.g., https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.4108/eai.3-12-2015.2262516 is one of the first works in the area - not cited here. As I mentioned earlier, there are hundreds to other works and comparison with a few other recent works would be better. Another two recent works worthy of comparison: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8264962 and https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1910/1910.01114.pdf.\r\n\r\nThe authors are also ambiguous about whether reporter accuracy is for the testing or training dataset.  More detailed results need to be provided for a better understanding and evidence that this technique performs better than contemporary work.\r\n\r\nOverall, lack of novelty (or at least clarity on novelty), discussion of related work, comparison with existing work, and sparse results need to be drastically improved.", "write_date": "2020-06-19T07:53:08Z", "update_date": "2020-06-22T15:45:52Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 305, "fields": {"subject": "Enhanced Faulty Node Detection with Interval Weighting Factor for Distributed Systems - Journal of Communication and Networks", "content": "18-Jun-2020\r\n\r\nDear Dr. Kim:\r\n\r\nManuscript ID JCN19-DIV1-020 entitled &#34;Enhanced Faulty Node Detection with Interval Weighting Factor for Distributed Systems&#34; which you submitted to the Journal of Communications and Networks, has been reviewed.

In this case, the master node is considered as a bottle-neck in the application and any disorder in the master results in failure for faulty node detection. Hence, this method is not applicable for the distributed system. In distributed systems, the performance of the whole system or network does not depend on one specific node. Based on this fact, how authors assumed that this solution is distributed?\r\n\r\n\r\n2) The introduction needs more references to explain the problem definition. Most of the references in the introduction are used for applications rather than the problem definition.\r\n\r\n3) Page2, Column1, Line 5, 6: Authors compared the litmus test with faulty node detection. However, it is not clear how these two are similar to each other?\r\n\r\n4) At the end of the related work, Page2, Column2, line 42, 43: Authors conclude that the two previously mentioned works cannot interpret the faulty node. However, there is no explanation for this conclusion.\r\n\r\n5) Page3, Column2, Line 51, 52: “The cases may be more severe than the pure channel condition.” This sentence doesn’t have meaning in this paragraph and there is no adhesion between this sentence, the previous one, and the following one.\r\n\r\n6) In Figure 2, where the channel performance is considered to detect the faulty node?\r\n\r\n7) In Figure 2, there is a conditional block in the first column <Data is error interval>, what does it mean?\r\n\r\n8) In Figure 3, Why the \\beta_{3} arrow is ended; while, there is no detected BCH error?\r\n\r\n9) Page 5, Column 1, line 16: “As mentioned above, in this study, nine data sequences were\r\nused to represent the FIR filter coefficients.”, I couldn’t find it that you mentioned.\r\n\r\n10) Figure 4, What’s the meaning of a negative error interval? Why some plots have negative values?\r\n\r\n11) Table1, What is R and F? Are they defined?\r\n12) Authors defined d = \\rho_{F} / \\rho_{R}. What is d? What are \\rho_{R} and \\rho_{F}? Any definition for them?\r\n13) What is the purpose of Figure 9? Any explanation for that or the behavior of \\rho for raw data and filtered data?\r\n\r\nEditorial issues:\r\n--------------------------------\r\nThere are lots of grammatical issues.

I regret to inform you that based on the enclosed reviews and my own reading of your manuscript, I am unable to recommend its publication in IEEE Wireless Communications Letters.\r\n\r\nYour paper may not be resubmitted for review. The reasons for this are as follows: Based on my reading of the paper, the contribution of the paper is quite limited, which was confirmed by all three reviewers&#39; comments. As pointed out by the reviewers, the authors just simulated the performance of a well-known RL algoritm in solving a fault detection problem. This is far from the quality of the papers to be published on IEEE WCL.\r\n\r\nAdditional comments: Besides the limited contribution, the paper is poorly written and thus hard to follow. The simulation parameters are missing and no benchmark schemes were compared to prove the superiority of the proposed scheme. Please find below other problems raised by the reviewers.\r\n\r\nThe reviewers&#39; comments are found at the end of this email.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting your work to the IEEE Wireless Communications Letters.

Much of this paper is devoted to what is already known to the society. Sections I and II are background; Section III is an introcution to DRL; Section IV is simulation results. This paper describes very little about the contributions of the authors. In fact, the only message the authors convey to readers is: we tried to detect faulty nodes using DRL and this is our performance. Why not specifying the disadvantages of prior solutions to this problem and how your DRL scheme tackles the problem? Is there any difficulties you encountered when you design the DRL scheme (or it is too straightforward to be mentioned)?\r\n2. No benchmarks. How do readers evaluate the performance of DRL if there were no benchmarks? From Fig. 4, the miss-detection rate is as high as 38% when 10% of the nodes fails. In my view this is a poor perormance.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nGeneral comments: This paper investigated how to use deep reinforcement learning in edge computing systems for faulty-node detection. The topic is interesting, but the contribution is limited.\r\n\r\nComment 1: The motivation of using DRL is unclear. In the introduction, the authors claimed that &#34;DRL is intended to optimize data within a specific context.&#34;. Such a statement is confusing and hard to follow. What are the advantages of using DRL when compared with existing approaches, such as SVM?\r\n\r\nComment 2: In section III, the authors introduce the basic idea of DRL, which is well-known. The only contribution is the simulation results in Section IV.\r\n\r\nComment 3: The detection scenario appears not practical. Please justify the considered scenario by citing some references.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe work of this paper is not enough to be published in IEEE WCL. I suggest a rejection due to the following reasons.\r\n1) The paper is poorly written and organized. The main body of the paper (Section III) is devoted to describe the general backgrounds about deep neural networks, reinforcement learning, MDP, other than the proposed scheme. The technique contribution of this paper itself only is discussed in two/three paragraphs from a very high aspect. Some English writing styles are outdated.  \r\n2) The problem is not defined clearly. What are the actions, states and rewards in the reinforcement learning problem? Not defined and discussed explicitly. From the paper, I cannot find what kind of deep reinforcement learning algorithm is exploited to solve the problem.  \r\n3) It is unclear what kind of simulation model is used: How many sensor nodes in your system?

DL indeep provides a possible way for addressing some particular DOA estimation problems. Readers will appreciate it if papers can provide some insights to show what the particular problems are and why DL techniques are useful in addressing them.\r\nHowever, this manuscript does not provide such contributions. The authors just establish a deep (with more layers than that in existing methods) neural network to deal with the DOA estimation problem, and then demonstrate its effectiveness via some specially designed simulations. A great amount of doubts thus arise, e.g., why UAV? why multipath? why residual CNN? why so many layers? how will the framework behave if the scenario changes, including multipath/DOA/array parameters? and etc.\r\nFrom the perspective of this reviewer, this manuscript does not provide enough useful information for researchers in this area.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\n\r\n1. How the proposed approach differs from existing methods, and how this impacts performance.\r\n\r\n2.please describe how the power attenuation and the time delay are set during the simulation？\r\n\r\n\r\n3.The superiority of the proposed method over the classic model driven （e.g. MUSIC）method has not been clarified.\r\n\r\n4.How to deal with the problem of angle ambiguity when the array is NULA?\r\n\r\n5. Source code is not available. I believe it should be published for a deep evaluation of the work since the experiment data is synthetic. If there is some reason for not make it public, it should be described in the paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 4\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nIn this manuscript, the authors utilize an elaborately designed neural network to estimate the DOA of the received RF signals. There are some issues to be addressed before it would be published. I can provide comments as follows.\r\n\r\n1. The authors provide three major contributions in the introduction. However, the second and the third points are about the experimental results, which might not be regarded as major contributions.\r\n\r\n2. In this manuscript, the work of estimating DOA is formulated as a classification task rather than a regression task. It is suggested to explain whether the estimation accuracy is acceptable when considering the quantization error. Besides, the range of the angle is set as -80 degree to 80 degree, which might not be practical.\r\n\r\n3. The authors claim that their method considers the channel impairment introduced by multipath propagation. However, the evaluation results have not covered the effects of multi-paths. For example, how do the authors set the number of paths in their experiment.\r\n\r\n4. Also about the effects of multi-paths. Since there are more than one paths when considering the NLOS, each path will contain a DOA. Therefore, how do the authors ensure the estimation accuracy of the LOS’s DOA if the received signal is biased. The mechanism should be elaborated in detail.\r\n\r\n5. The writing is suggested to be further polished. Some sentences are too long.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 5\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis letters proposes an DOA Estimation method based on residual CNN and provides its performance in terms of estimation accuracy and RMSE. Generally speaking, the residual CNN structure is a mature technique that has been applied in many existing works, thus, this review feels the novelty and contribution of this letter are limited. It is not clear why this technique must be used for the DOA estimation problem. Is it necessary to use residual CNN for this DoA estimation problem? What is the performance if we simply remove the residual branch in the current network structure in Fig. 2?\r\n\r\nOther comments:\r\n&#8195;\r\n1. This letters only provides some performance results with different hyper-parameters settings, but lacks of the explanation, analysis, or insights how to set these hyper-parameters, such as filter size, number of filters, input dimensions. Table II actually does not contain too much useful information, but only shows that the performance is better when there are more trainable parameters, which is common in all works related to neutral networks.\r\n\r\n2. The two existing methods for comparison need some data preprocessing, but the proposed method does not. It is not clear what the performance improvement comes from. Is it due to the residual network structure or due to the direct processing to the raw data without any preprocessing?\r\n\r\n3. It is not clear what Eq.(4) means and what the connection between it and Eq.(2).\r\n\r\n4. It seems not fair to compare NULA with ULA with two different apertures. Better to compare them with the same aperture.\r\n\r\n5. It would be better to open some data and source code, which would greatly increase the reliability of the simulation results.\r\n\r\n6. In the simulation, it seems neither the accuracy nor RMSE is defined. The setting of multipath propagation is not explained either.", "write_date": "2020-06-29T15:37:01Z", "update_date": "2020-07-07T11:15:40Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 309, "fields": {"subject": "Selecting Gaussian Process Regression Kernels for Evaluating MIMO Antenna Configuration Journal: ICT Express( Revision)", "content": "Ref: ICTE_2020_114_R1\r\nTitle: Selecting Gaussian Process Regression Kernels for Evaluating MIMO Antenna Configuration\r\nJournal: ICT Express\r\n\r\nDear Professor.

However, based on the revised manuscript, I have some important questions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1) In general, as shown in the equation (7.10) of [Tse07], the capacity of the MIMO channel is an increasing function of min(Tx,Rx). It is required to clarify the reason why the 5X20 antenna configuration is optimal.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2) In Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the capacity is not an increasing function of min(Tx,Rx), which is totally different from the the equation (7.10) of [Tse07]. Why the capacity in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 is not an increasing function of min(Tx,Rx)?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3) In the equation (6), $\\delta$ is suggested be more specific form as in the equation (7.10) of [Tse07].\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4) In Fig. 2, it seems that there are two pair of true-predicted points at the 2 Tx antennas.

However, there are some issues related to the results and theoretical derivations provided in the paper. The comments are listed below:\r\n1. More significant contributions are required. Please check three points of key contributions. Except first one others are not much significant.\r\n2. The authors indicated semiveriogram after equation 11. This term should be explained in the text.\r\n3. Further clarifications on Fig. 4 are required. Present clarifications are not sufficient to my belief.\r\n4. Is the equation 17 complete? Complete equation with proper clarifications on all terms are required.\r\n5. In 3.3.2, the authors indicated Markov localization and particle filtering. Please explain and define them with proper referencing.\r\n6. Simulation parameters need to be tabulated.\r\n7. Where did the authors indicate average capacity in the system model and theoretical analysis portion? However, the results in FIg. 9 is showing plots of the average capacity.\r\n8. How did the authors get expression of throughput with KF and other techniques? I could not locate them.\r\n9. In conclusion, RSSI is wrongly written as resource signal strength indicator.\r\n\r\n#2 Submitted by: Reviewer 2\r\nOverall, this is a very interesting paper and a useful contribution to the literature. I have two suggestions that would make this paper more accessible and useful. First, this paper reads somewhat clumsily, as the text is missing many articles (i.e. &#34;the&#34;, &#34;a&#34;, and &#34;an&#34;). This is a not uncommon situation for those whose first language is not English. Additionally, in some places, the grammatical structure is somewhat awkward. To make this clearer, I have attached a PDF file which contains an example of what I mean. This situation can be readily overcome by having a native English speaker review the paper for grammar and structure.\r\n\r\nThe second suggestion is to provide some additional technical clarification in section 4 Performance Evaluation. It would be useful to better characterize the two-dimensional area wherein the performance of the two approaches are being evaluated. There is a general statement that an environment is assumed that has &#34;...many phenomena affecting the propagation of signal such as shadowing, fading and noise effects.&#34; While this clearly indicates that there are a mix of statistical and deterministic sources of channel degradation, it would be very useful to discuss how this part of the channel is characterized. For instance, if this channel interference is primarily deterministic, are more or less sensors required than if the channel interference is primarily statistical. If a 50-50 mixture (however one defines that) of deterministic and statistical interference is present, does that evaluation result in an &#34;optimum&#34; number of sensors for maximizing usage of the spectrum. Detailed consideration of these aspects of the problem may be beyond the scope of the submitted paper, but should be at least addressed, and possibly discussed as an area for further investigation in the conclusion section, much like the discussion of the hybrid CRN scheme.\r\n\r\nAgain, a very interesting paper.", "write_date": "2020-06-30T18:17:34Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.134.83", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 311, "fields": {"subject": "Sanjay Bhardwaj, Dong-Seong Kim &#34;Dragonfly Approach for Resource Allocation in Industrial Wireless Network&#34;, Physical Communication,2020", "content": "Dear Professor Kim,\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting your manuscript to Physical Communication.\r\n\r\nI have completed my evaluation of your manuscript.

The authors should address the following comments in order to further improve the presentation of their manuscript as well as its scientific depth. Regarding the multi-objective optimization problems, game theoretic approaches have been proposed in the literature such as, Tsiropoulou, E.E., Katsinis, G., and Papavassiliou, S.. &#34;Utility-based power control via convex pricing for the uplink in CDMA wireless networks.&#34; 2010 European Wireless Conference (EW). IEEE, 2010, D. J. Goodman and N. B. Mandayam, &#34;Power control for wireless data&#34;, IEEE Personal Comm., vol. 7, pp. 48-54, April 2000, to deal with multi variable decision making and optimization in the field of resource allocation in wireless networks. The authors should provide some additional discussion regarding those methods and the differences compared to the\r\nones provided in this manuscript. Also, the authors should provide a table of notation within the manuscript to enable the reader to easily follow the provided analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #2: The authors have addressed my comments in this revision, though not satisfactorily. A substantial improvement (see the comments below) is required before the manuscript can be accepted.\r\n\r\n- The manuscript suffers several typos. &#34;,i.e.&#34;, &#34;, where,&#34;, and so on.\r\n- &#39;S&#39; defines both the number of scattered path and the data item?? This is confusing to follow. Also, notations related with sets are not well defined throughout the manuscript. The authors must maintain consistency in using notations.\r\n- The range defined channel model components in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) does not seem correct to me. The authors should carefully define the Rician channel model.\r\n- The way (6) is defined is not clear. What is $\\forall n$ used for here? Please update this definition. Similarly with (9).\r\n- In (12), why it is $\\mathbb{T}_{\\alpha_1 =1}$?\r\n- In (24), extrapolate the variable &#39;x&#39; in reference to (23) for a clear understanding.\r\n- (26) is not well defined to understand Jain&#39;s Fairness. You have to define what R.V &#39;Y&#39; stands for first. Alternatively, the authors can use $j(y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n)$. Also, I think the authors should define its (Fairness) meaning. &#34; every metric has the same potential as well as opportunity and j(Y) represents a fairer model at\r\nindividual level.&#34; -> this is not clear to me.\r\n- Figures need improvements.

Thus, the content (or the form) of a task request passed to the main server is not defined or formalised; we can suppose that it is a working station and an order of pickup or of delivery for required load quantity, but this is not clearly expressed. The formulation of the problem (equation 1) integrates temporal aspects, but nothing is said about the way to evaluate these quantities. Moreover, the constraint that prohibits passing more than once to a station, does not seem compatible with the possibility of altering the route if a new task appears during the mission. The interest of the set maximum detour ratio is unexplained and questionable. I’m not sure that the formulation of the problem (equation 1) integrates an order constraint such as before delivering a load to a working station, the load has to be recovered from another station before that. In the same way, the modification of load carried by a robot with pickup and delivery does not seem to be taken into account. Concerning the simulation, except proving that load indicators can be evaluated, the interest of the results is questionable. As can be expected, the more robots are available, the more tasks can be performed... More globally, the formulation of the problem lacks rigour and the presented solution to the problem or the associated simulations seems difficult to reproduce by someone else. So, that is not really scientific. Despite these criticisms, considering that it is a work in progress, I suggest to accept the submission, mainly because the theme is interesting and the paper is nice to read. “edge computing” could be removed form Index Terms since the task allocation between edge servers is not really treated.\r\n\r\n======================================== REVIEWER 2 ========================================\r\n\r\nC.

Despite the fact that in introduction it is said that the problem will be elaborated in second section, it is not.\r\n\r\nFrom what I have inferred, authors have already an algorithm that selects the &#34;best&#34; solution from a pool of pick and carrier robots.\r\n\r\nThis paper intends to extrapolate this result for a distributed control hierarchy of edge servers (as a middle layer), supervised by a main server; all included in a smart factory environment.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear what the smart factory environment requires from this hierarchy (what means &#34;smart&#34; vs &#34;flexible&#34;, for instance). And here may be cited some references dealing with the smart factory concept (which has a relatively precise meaning).\r\n\r\nIt was not very clear from the beginning what means supervision from the main server; finally, I have concluded, that this supervision means a choice between what edge server will receive the task. \r\n\r\nIt is to be discussed how efficient is to let all edge servers work for a solution, if, as I have understood, the main server will choose mainly between feasible solutions, based on the actual load of the edge server. So, it is not the best solution, globally. (or not ? not clear)\r\n\r\nSimulation results are rather previsible, for the configuration of carrier robots, this kind of case study is rather a proof of concept. It would have been more relevant if the presented solution would have been compared with some other already existent approach.\r\n\r\nActually, the paper may benefit from an analysis of existent approaches for the same problem, clearly underlining the contributions of the paper.\r\n\r\n======================================== REVIEWER 3 ========================================\r\n\r\nC.

Future works are: (a) inclusion of a model for determining operational cost and (b) exploration of other metaheuristic algorithms. \r\n\r\nThe following points should be taken into account:\r\n\r\n1) According to (1), all carrier robots have the same capacity! This is an unnecessary restriction in the formulation of the problem. \r\n\r\n2) The variables and parameters in the 3rd , 4th and 5th constraint have to be formally defined. \r\n\r\n3) Also, in the constraints in (1), symbols depending upon the type of the carrier robot should be used. \r\n\r\n4) The maximum speed of the various types of carrier robots should be used in the formulation of the problem. \r\n\r\n5) The expressions carrier robot type A (or B) and carrier robot type I (or II) are used alternatively for the same type of robots. It should be corrected. \r\n\r\n6) The contribution is poor. In particular, the definition of the problem introduced is not clear. The approach for the solution of the problem is already been published. \r\n\r\n7) The future work for the problem at hand is obscure. The use of “other metaheuristic algorithms” is not a clear direction. Furthermore, the inclusion “a model for determining operational cost will … be considered” is not also a clear direction. \r\n\r\n8)The use of metaheuristic algorithm instead of an extensive search algorithm is not justified. Is the computational time, required for an extensive solution, inhibitive? \r\n\r\n9) The presentation of the paper should be improved. English should also be improved.\r\n\r\n======================================== REVIEWER 4 ========================================\r\n\r\nC.

Abstract is generally written. The inception of DS, REE and ESS, reliability has been undoubtedly a key concern and researchers have taken different routes to explore the solution. Please specifically mention the contribution and highlight the approaches of this paper in the abstract for bolstering upon the novelty of the work. Moreover, since there are mixture of tenses in the abstract, kindly revise the abstract avoiding grammatical mistakes.\r\n2. Please avoid the use of lumped references such as [8]-[22] in page 2, as it does not signify detailed literature study on ESS. Instead, please elaborate significant studies and correlate how the outcomes impact the study.\r\n3. Since the review includes literatures throughout the paper, section I and II could be modified, reorganized and even merged to smoothen the flow of information, and to avoid the duplication of the contribution mentioned in both the sections. Moreover, in one portion of section II, it is mentioned that previous studies [36-41] overlooked different aspects enlisted by the authors. There are other new papers on reliability particularly related to the mentioned topics which should be brought into consideration for a fruitful and updated study. Please add recent works on the mentioned technologies related to reliability to improve the content of the paper.\r\n4. Please create a nomenclature section to enlist the symbols and abbreviations from the paper for enhanced readability.\r\n5. Section IV, V and VI summarizes existing works on smart grid, renewables and IoT, but do not clearly correlates the relation to the grid reliability and resilience. Please remove the known materials from those sections (i.e. definitions, cases not related to the main concept of the paper), and kindly correlate how these innovations are contributing to the reliability to focus more on the core theme of the paper.\r\n6. Section VII, being one of the crucial section in the paper, requires further studies. Instead of mentioning what to do in each sections, some indication on how to implement the research challenges and how the researchers are pursuing the problems stated would be more valuable. This would enhance the quality of the paper, as well as provide insights to the readers in the domain. For example, many recent studies on smart grids encircles around big data and artificial intelligence, which can be added in the paper for indicating ways to improve reliability. Please consider studying recent reviews, for example the following article, for the improvement of the paper on the topic of IoT, big data and machine learning. Kindly use it only if and where appropriate and applicable.\r\n‘Application of big data and machine learning in smart grid, and associated security concerns: A review’\r\n7. Please update the figure captions to highlight what information the figures refers to, so that the figure can be understood independently without the help from the in-text explanations. For example, Figure 1 caption should mention the concept of one way and two way communication, as this is the major purpose of the figure. For figure 5, it is not clear what is inferred by ‘component’ from the diagram, figure 6 and 9 should mention the outcome in short what is determined from the graph, fig 7 should explain in brief the contents shown in DER technology. Please modify accordingly as the captions would help the readers to better understand the figures without any reference to the text.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\nDoes the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: Fairly\r\n\r\nIs the paper technically sound?: Yes\r\n\r\nIs the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: Somewhat, but the presentation could be improved.\r\n\r\nAre the references provided applicable and sufficient?: More reference pertaining to the recent technologies could be presented.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Reject (updates required before resubmission)\r\n\r\nComments:\r\n1.      Figure 2 and figure 3 seem irrelevant to the research work. Instead, I would like to suggest adding some graphical representation illustrating the current challenges of this research.\r\n2.      A lot of discussions have been added regarding how many research papers have been reviewed, even how those papers have been collected. It needs not to be mentioned, as it is not pertinent to your research work.\r\n3.      “It covers the related works published mainly from 2016 to 2018”&#8212;It is recommended to enlist at least five years of publications.\r\n4.      In section VII, the authors presented the challenges and the future works that require to be performed. However, the author did not present any of their thoughts about the way to solve those challenges. It is not expected to present a solution for all the challenges, however, a discussion regarding the way for a probable solution for some of the challenges by analyzing current literature will also suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\nDoes the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: Yes\r\n\r\nIs the paper technically sound?: Moderately\r\n\r\nIs the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: Yes\r\n\r\nAre the references provided applicable and sufficient?: Yes.", "write_date": "2020-07-10T09:40:26Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.134.90", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 315, "fields": {"subject": "", "content": "Am impressed reading these blogs.The content is insightful.Get us more of it.Check out our site at   <a href=\"https://www.nursingwritingservices.com/tina-jones-shadow-health\r\n\">Tina Jones Shadow Health</a> for our very friendly writing services..

Please clearly mention what exactly is the latency based objective function, what you are trying to do (minimize the overall latency? (7)), in reference with (4)-(7).\r\n- In (19), it should be p_j , not p_m.\r\n- Eqn (28) is vague. How the criteria for selection is defined?

The results showed an effective trade off in user equipment concentrations (base station density) and transmit power under a guaranteed connectivity constraint.\r\nI have major comments:\r\n1: Scenario in Figure 2 is not clear. Reviewer do not understand the dotted line, is a small cell connect directly to Core network? How CP and UP are distributed, Is Marco BS send Control channel and small cell only mmWave. This is not clear from Figure\r\n2: Reviewer cannot see anything new in the paper, as already a lot of work has been done on the layout of mmWave BS and it power modeling.\r\n3: What about backhaul energy consumption in Figure 3?\r\n4: How NLOS will be the model in Figure 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper proposes a stochastic approach-based base station deployment scheme that aims to optimize the network energy efficiency. The ideas in this paper, however, are not presented in an organized fashion, and the concepts as well as the notations used in this paper should be defined more clearly. In addition, the simulation results lack comparison with state-of-the-art base station deployment schemes, as there is only one benchmark. The specific comments on this paper are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The entire part of Section IV should be written more clearly, as there are many notations that are not defined. For example, \\zeta_{\\mathrm{Con}}, C_{p}, and \\bar{p}_{c} are not defined, which makes the reader hard to follow (there are more notations that are not defined other than these three notations).\r\n\r\n2. Rephrase the paragraph below (4) more clearly. In particular, explain the random lattice process that approximates the MTG considered in this paper with more details. In addition, define what the inverse operation of f is.\r\n\r\n3. The paper aims at optimizing the base station deployment in a realistic mmWave propagation environment. The mmWave propagation model adopted in this paper, however, seems too simple, as the propagation condition is either a single LOS path or blockage. A more realistic scenario is to consider various factors that affect the propagation condition, e.g., NLOS paths, O2I penetration loss, etc.\r\n\r\n4. The simulation results lack comparison with state-of-the-art base station deployment schemes, as there is only one benchmark. A more thorough comparison with other schemes is required to prove the superior performance of the proposed scheme.\r\n\r\n5. There are many notations throughout the paper that are either not defined or unclear, P_{\\mathrm{Th}} for instance.\r\n\r\n6. The figures should be at the top of the page as recommended by the IEEE style manual.\r\n\r\n7. Why do the authors use both American and British English? For instance, the authors use optimize and optimise, characterize and characterise, and summarize and summarise.\r\n\r\n8. There are many notations that are not written consistently. For example, P_{\\mathrm{Tx}} is sometimes written as p_{Tx} or P_{Tx}, which confuses the reader. Also, the authors should carefully revise the paper, as there are many words that are not capitalized, e.g., section, table, etc.", "write_date": "2020-09-07T20:20:17Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.140", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 321, "fields": {"subject": "Godwin Brown Tunze, Thien Huynh-The, Jae-Min Lee, and Dong-Seong Kim, “Sparsely Connected CNN for Ef&#64257;cient Automatic Modulation Recognition,” IEEE Transaction on Vehicular Technology, 2020.(Major Revision)", "content": "Dear Prof. Kim:\r\n\r\nThe review of your paper\r\n\r\nVT-2020-02150: Sparsely Connected CNN for Efficient Automatic Modulation Recognition\r\n\r\nhas been completed.

However, it still needs major modifications before acceptance.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. There are a lot of language mistakes that need to be addressed. Please proofread the paper carefully.\r\n\r\n2. Compare and cite the proposed algorithm against the latest work in the same domain, such as “CSFL: A novel unsupervised convolution neural network approach for visual pattern classification” , “Face recognition: A novel un-supervised convolutional neural network method” , “ A Benchmark Dataset and Learning High-level Semantic Embeddings of Multimedia for Cross-media Retrieval” , “ Optimization of CNN through novel training strategy for visual classification problems”, “Unsupervised pre-trained filter learning approach for efficient convolution neural network”.\r\n\r\n3. The training of CNN based algorithm is very computational expensive. Justify, the reason behind author choice of CNN based algorithm for automatic modulation recognition.\r\n\r\n4. Explain why the author choose multiple convolution layers simultaneously in their architecture. However, we are aware that convolution operator extracts low-level features in the initial layers and high-level features in higher layers. The benchmark CNN architecture follows alternatively convolution layers. Justify?\r\n\r\n5. The experimental results in this paper are too simple and there is a lack of specific comparison of different methods. It is difficult to explain the superiority of the proposed SCGNet model. The experimental results give too few examples, and more comparisons and examples can be added.\r\n\r\n6. Figure 1 about convolution is not very expressive. It is recommended to improve it to illustrate better the concept of convolution.\r\n\r\n7. In my opinion, it will help a lot showing a simple example for every convolution type to illustrate it. The description of some convolution types is superficial (e.g., grouped convolution).\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\n<b>ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR</b>:\r\nThis paper proposes a new convolutional neural network (CNN) called SCGNet for low-complexity and robust modulation recognition in intelligent communication receivers. The idea seems interesting. I have some suggestions:\r\n\r\n1.- An initial table with all the acronyms could help to understand the manuscript.\r\n2.- As the model is a sparse network, I recommend the authors to provide a state of art disscusion about Deep Efficient Models as: EfficientNet, ShiftResNet, TresNet, SEResNeXt50, MixNet, MobileNet, etc.\r\n3.- Please, include a link to the code in the paper\r\n4.- Please, include a deeper discussion about the FLOPs.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\n<b>ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR</b>:\r\nWriting:\r\n1.

Please note that only the submissions which pass the preliminary review are scheduled for a full peer review. Regretfully, the preliminary review concluded that the paper is not suitable for publication in the IEEE Signal Processing Letters. Some specific comments from the editorial board members are below:\r\n\r\n========\r\nEditor 1:\r\nThis paper presents a Deep learning based DoA estimation in a UAV surveillance application. The main contribution is the neural network architecture that achieves a desirable performance on the DOA estimation problem and its supporting interpretation. There has been burgeoning growth in the development of Deep learning methods for DoA estimation in the past few years which this paper has not considered. A sample of the recent literature in that regard is here:\r\n1. Li, Qinglong, Xueliang Zhang, and Hao Li. &#34;Online direction of arrival estimation based on deep learning.&#34; 2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). IEEE, 2018.\r\n2. Liu, Zhang-Meng, Chenwei Zhang, and S. Yu Philip. &#34;Direction-of-arrival estimation based on deep neural networks with robustness to array imperfections.&#34; IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation 66.12 (2018): 7315-7327.\r\n3. Huang, Hongji, et al. &#34;Deep learning for super-resolution channel estimation and DOA estimation based massive MIMO system.&#34; IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology 67.9 (2018): 8549-8560.\r\n\r\nIt is important to compare the contribution of this work in this scientific context, and identify similar approaches for comparative evaluation. I recommend that the authors resubmit taking this into account.\r\n--------\r\nEditor 2:\r\n\r\nI agree with Editor-1&#39;s important comment that the paper misses to mention and compare the proposed RFDOA-Net with recent body of work in this context. It is critical to properly place contributions of the paper within the context of recent state-of-the-art methodologies.\r\n========\r\n\r\nPlease note that according to IEEE Signal Processing Society policy 6.16 &#34;Handling of Rejected Papers&#34; (https://signalprocessingsociety.org/volunteers/policy-and-procedures-manual), the Society strongly discourages resubmission of rejected manuscripts more than once.

The training models of the related works mentioned in the paper are mostly only for one dataset. However, the model proposed by the authors is more versatile which can effectively train three different types of intrusion detection datasets, and get a good hit rate.\r\n\r\nThe paper is well-structured. The layers of DNN are clear. Terms are clearly explained and easily understood, but regarding the method of DNN, the innovation is not enough. Most of the paper only mentioned what to do, but did not say how to do it (e.g. hidden layer weights).\r\n\r\nThere are some typos and grammatical errors.

The weighting factor is used to declare the suspected node at the time of the received error positions. A BCH code that has inserted into the CRC code in the master node is used to detect the error position. In general, the subject of this paper is good, but there are some problems that should be considered:\r\n\r\n1) Grammatically, the text is written in a hurry and has many mistakes. For example, in Section IV they say, &#34;Therefore, the nodes and channel performance were combine via the BCH and CRC codes to produced raw data.&#34; that should be &#34;...were combined...&#34;\r\nor, in sub-section of &#39;Raw Data Analysis&#39; they say, &#34;Moreover, the raw data analysis involves basic evaluation the statistical characteristics of the raw data. The suspected node is conclude while the interval&#34;, while should be &#34;... evaluation of the statistical.... The suspected node is concluded while ...&#34;. There more cases like these 3 examples which are grammatically wrong.\r\n\r\n2) I have some concerns about sub-section &#39;B.

However, there still exits a room to improve. For example, symVal (the symbol value) in Algorithm 2 is derived from the function const() based on the constellation diagram. What is an example of it? (Or you can explain more about the constellation diagram.)\r\n\r\nHowever, my bigger concern is that the paper does not provide any quantitative comparison of the proposed scheme with those previously proposed in the literature. Can you provide (at least) a table that compares the ODG value of the proposed scheme with previous ones?\r\n\r\nAlso, I&#39;m not sure if simulation results can represent the feasibility of the approach. Can you provide a small application that generates imperceptible steganography if given any WAV file?\r\n\r\nThe editorial quality is good in general. But there are some grammatical errors. Here are some examples:\r\n- In abstract: Quality of proposed technique -> Quality of the proposed technique\r\n- provide (line 5 from the bottom of page 3) -> provides\r\n\r\nSuggestion decision: Major revision or Reject\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #2: The paper proposes an audio digital data hiding technique by combining rounding modulation with other conventional techniques.\r\n\r\nMy first comment is that the writing throughout the paper can definitely be improved.\r\n\r\nThe introduction is poorly presented. There is no link between contrasting audio steganography with audio watermarking, and what the paper attempts to do. Why introduce these methods in the introduction then immediately conclude with the organization of the paper.\r\n\r\nThe writeup on related work is rather brief. This area of research has been around for many years, yet the related work section is cursory, focusing more on techniques that were combined in this paper and on the paper&#39;s contribution. Of the contributions, only number 2 is somewhat legitimate. The others are byproducts of experiments using the proposed technique, and not actual contributions.\r\n\r\nThe main contribution of the paper is the digit rounding technique, as the paper combines this technique with other existing techniques. The authors state:\r\n&#34;After the division process, a part of the digit from the result will be constant while the other will change. The dynamic part of the result was then used to modulate the secret information while the constant or static part was used to extract the information.&#34;\r\nIf the static part is required to extract the information, then this seems to contradict the purpose of hiding the data. This is due to the fact that the static information must somehow be shared a priori before the hidden data can be extracted. Is this generated using a shared secret key that is known to authorized users? This is fine for a watermarking technique, less so for steganography. The authors state that the proposed method is closely related to steganography rather than watermarking. The authors also state in the conclusion that &#34;Further study on the application of a specific scenario using this system is recommended...&#34;. This emphasizes the point on the proposed technique&#39;s practicality.\r\n\r\nComparison of the proposed technique with state of the art techniques in audio data hiding proposed by other researchers is limited. Table 3 provides comparisons with conventional data hiding techniques; it is unclear whether these were standard implementations or those proposed by other researchers. This is not a new field of study and much research on it exists. Furthermore, it appears that the results were for a single audio file. As there is insufficient experimental work, the results are unconvincing.\r\n\r\nSuggested decision: Reject\r\n&#8239;", "write_date": "2020-09-29T22:35:07Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.134.90", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 343, "fields": {"subject": "Mareska Pratiwi Maharani, Philip T.

The authors have presented a report on the application of NM500 processors for laser marking. They have also presented their system design and configuration. There is a need for research on cross-layer design explorations for safety-critical systems.\r\n\r\nThere are a few key points, from the reviews, which I summarize here for your attention:\r\n1) As the authors note, not much work has been published on the topic of NM500 applications. The authors previous work [14] is the only other work published on the NM500 processor. However, we observe that the submitted work is a report on another case-study on the use of NM500 processor for ASDAS application. The consensus is that the submissions lacks in novelty of technical contribution.\r\n\r\n2) The experiments and evaluations do not highlight on why the NM500 is different and unique in comparison to other neurmorphic processors. In addition, the comparitive studies do not include other processors and also are not normalized against established benchmarks (identified in [11]) in literature.\r\n\r\nThe authors have presented some detailed experimental evaluations on this case-study. For a potential resubmission of the research content, I would recommend that the authors reorganize the manuscript to include details and explain the research process in a way that would help future system designers and researchers to appreciate the use of the NM500 processor (and similar other processors).\r\n\r\nReviewer(s)&#39; Comments to Author:\r\n\r\nReviewer: 1\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper concerns the implementation of an image classification system.\r\n\r\nNo real details are given about either the hardware or the image recognition task.

The motivation is that the existing schemes are too complicated to be implemented in sensor networks. However, the followings points are not explained and verified correctly. \r\n1. What scenario is considered in this paper? and why UAV is used here. usually UAV is out-door scenarios, where GPS works very well. The authors mention there is cost using GPS, however, this is not properly discussed. \r\n2. There lacks a detailed analysis on the implementation cost of this proposed scheme. \r\n3. the comparison schemes are too old. it is hard to judge the performance only according to these results. \r\n4. The simulation scenarios are not explained. \r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2 \r\n\r\nComments to the Author \r\nThis paper discusses the localization with low cost with the assistance of UAV. There is some value for this work, but I would say it is quite far from a IEEE Transaction paper. Below are some of my more detailed comments. \r\n1. The main point is that our accuracy is not too bad with low overhead especially for communication. But how can we justify the achieved accuracy is good, like 2 meters? Better get some comparison data. For the overhead, true, we save some GPS communication workload, but how about the communication overhead with the UAV. More investigation shall be conducted. Also, the cost comes from many parts, say we have to buy UAV, and how long can this UAV fly? What will be the amortized cost? We rather buy good sensors with larger battery? Those questions are likely to be raised up by the readers, and it should be great if the paper includes more discussion on those parts. \r\n2. The writing shall be improved. for example, some description in the system architecture actually shall be the background or the related works. Quite often the sentences are not presented in a professional way, or even with quite some grammar errors and typos. \r\n3. Please justify our setting and assumption is possible, i.e., why 15 blocks? Sometime like the proof of the closest pair problem, where we clearly know why it is 15. Without good justification, I would think the research is just a result of some random adventures. \r\n4. For the 2-UAV paths. For the long-term view, you let them fly both horizontally and vertically. That is fine. But could you also describe a bit about the short-term part? say I am curious about sometimes they are near and sometimes far away. Any impact? \r\n5. Figures some of them are blur. \r\n6. Technical descriptions are often unnecessary. Like if people do not know std, then maybe he should not read a transactions paper. Also, for the algorithm, it is not the contribution of this paper. Using much space to describe those popular and no high-tech is quite wasteful. \r\n7. Figure 9 may should unity the y-axis range. So we can see which signal is weak and which is strong. Then we get the idea of which one is closer. \r\n8. The comparison algorithms are outdated. And seems that the improvement does not make any big impact. \r\n9. The precision in the table shall be better. Too many unnecessary digits are kind of the noise for readers. As long as we can make our point to say this one is good that one is not, it should be sufficient. \r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3 \r\n\r\nComments to the Author \r\nThe authors basically apply extreme machine learning for UAV-assisted localization of the sensor nodes and claim that this method improves the accuracy of localization while also reducing the computation overhead. While localization is indeed an important problem, the scientific contribution of this paper is not significant, and the manuscript has are several weak points- both scientific and semantic. The paper lacks novelty authors simply apply ELM for the case of UAV-enabled sensor localization. Neither ELM nor UAV-assisted scenario are new. In addition, the performance evaluation and analysis is limited to an area of a total of 100m by 100m with each block of 10m by 10m. This is Certainly not sufficient to prove the effectiveness of or improvement brought by the proposed scheme. Also the writing of the paper is poor which makes it difficult to read. \r\n\r\nReviewer: 4 \r\n\r\nComments to the Author \r\nA UAV- and shallow neural network-based sensor nodes localization technique is proposed and its effectiveness is demonstrated in terms of location accuracy and solution efficiency, using synthetic data. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy major concerns are the following: \r\n1. It&#39;s unclear where the proposed algorithm will be run. The paper mentions using a &#34;computation system other than the sensor nodes&#34; but without providing further details. Elaborate on the computation system. Where is it located? For example, in Fig. 8, where is the SLFN training implemented? How do the sensor nodes communicate the measured RSSI to the computation system? What is the latency? What information is communicated from the computation system back to the sensor nodes? What is the latency? \r\n\r\n2. UAV trajectory shown in Fig. 2: why constrain the UAVs to move in horizontal and vertical directions? How to prevent collisions between the 2 UAVs? \r\n\r\n3. Received RSSI at the sensor nodes: How many receive antennas are on each sensor node? How does each sensor node distinguish between the beacon signal from the UAV left and right antennae? \r\n\r\n4. Connection states: how long is a connection state? What is the relationship between T and \\m_k shown in Fig. 5? How is the value of T determined? \r\n\r\n5. Eqn. 3: an exponent of 2 is missing in the numerator: (R_i - \\mu)^2 \r\n\r\n6. What is the difference between N and n shown in Fig. 6? \r\n\r\n7. Instead of setting the output layer to the target output in eqn. (6) and then solving for \\beta in eqn. (7), why not minimize the error between the predicted output (eqn. (5)) and the target output? \r\n\r\n8. Network Configuration and Simulation settings are NOT specified. Hence, it&#39;s difficult to put the presented results in proper context: Please state in a Table the assumed values in your simulations of the following parameters: \r\na) Size of the sensor field (i.e. network area) \r\nb) Propagation channel parameters: L_0, d_0, \\alpha, \\sigma \r\nc) Transmit power by each UAV antenna \r\nd) Number of sensor nodes in the service area \r\ne) Number of UAVs in the service area \r\nf) Value of \\m_k, maximum number of connection states for each node k \r\ng) Value of T, number of connection states \r\nh) Value of N, number of training samples (i.e., size of training data) \r\ni) Size of test data \r\nj) Why set \\N_h = 20? \r\n\r\n9) All the results are based on synthetic data, consider using actual field data. \r\n\r\n10) Figs. 10 & 11: What is the assumed activation function? \r\n\r\n11) In Figs. 12 and 13, why does the hardlimit activation function perform better at the training stage but poorly at the testing phase? \r\n\r\n12) Fig. 14: what activation function was assumed? \r\n\r\n13) Your results show that the EML exhibits the best location accuracy and best solution efficiency compared to BP and SVM. So what is the tradeoff for the EML? I.e., what are EML&#39;s limitations? \r\n\r\n13. Editorial/Presentation quality: The paper requires a major editorial rework. The presentation quality is very low. \r\n\r\nAE Comments: \r\nAssociate Editor \r\nComments to the Author: \r\n(There are no comments.

The experiments of the average number of tasks assigned doesn&#39;t really show the impacts on the main server, e.g., server overload.\r\nSecondly, this paper lacks comparision with SOTA methods, which makes the experiments less convincing.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper needs some improvement. The proposed algorithm is not compared with other existing algorithms. DARP algorithm is mentioned here. Is there any relationship with the proposed algorithm and DARP algorithm? If yes, then what improvement you have observed in your proposed algorithm than the existing algorithm? How bio inspired algorithm is used in this matter? Which bio-inspired algorithm is used here? How much time will be required by main server to select the best edge server? What should be the optimum time and optimum number of robots? The overall setup is not shown also. Do the work done with real life robots? If yes, then how the cloud main server, edge server and the robots are connected to work together? Is there any set up in your laboratory? Do MATLAB 2018 is sufficient to complete the overall process? Have you used any other software as Network simulator or Cloud Simulator? If yes, the include that framework also. The paper need some English language correction and check that the figures are in between the reference list. More papers should be referenced and they should be cited well. The papers in the reference list may be arranged year wise also. The page count should increase. Edge computing concept and its application should be discussed in the introduction portion. The source of data to generate the charts and graphs are not clearly mentioned in the paper. &#39;Factory area size 100 m × 100 m&#39; is it by guess or you really have such set up?

They constructed a signal model using a non-uniform linear antenna array for signal acquisition and generated a synthetic dataset for performance evaluation. A network architecture named RFDoA-Net was designed by one-dimensional convolution kernel in each residual block to successively learn the former feature maps of the time varying signal correlation to enhance the feature extraction process via skip connection. During experiments, the authors studied the DoA estimation accuracy with different pre-specified hyper-parameters, including the number of filters and the filter sizes along with several input data lengths. They also investigated the estimation performance under various configurations of uniform linear array and statistically measured the accuracy of arrival angle via root mean square error.\r\n\r\nBy reading this correspondence, the Reviewer would raise the following major comments:\r\n\r\n1. The justification of the novelty of this work is not sufficient. Recently, CNN has been applied to solve communications problems, such as optimization and estimation. However, what is the theoretical novelty of this correspondence, rather than applying existing CNNs to UAV systems to solve the DoA estimation problem?\r\n\r\n2. The theoretical discussion of the complexity of the proposed CNN framework is not provided. What are the impacts of system parameters on the complexity? A table summarizing the number of parameters for a given system is not scientifically rigorous.\r\n\r\n3. How did the authors evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed CNN framework? The authors are suggested to verify the framework with some existing solutions, such as some optimal solutions that were theoretically obtained in some (special) cases.\r\n\r\n4. Is there any content under Section IV-A?\r\n\r\n5. The presentation quality of this correspondence is low. The authors are suggested to revise the paper significantly.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\n<b>ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR</b>:\r\nThis paper estimates the direction of arrival of RF signals through a convolution neural network. The effectiveness of the proposed estimation scheme has been validated by computer simulation and compared with existing schemes. In spite of a timely and interesting topic and the adequate contribution, I still have some questions and comments for the authors to refine the paper:\r\n1. The description of the system model is not very clear. Do all UAVs transmit their signal to the same controller or to the controller corresponding to each UAV? Do controller have M antennas to receive the signal transmitted from UAVs. Since UAVs fly over the air, their transmitted signal should propagate through a different environment. Why can they travel through the same K paths? Moreover, does UAVs transmit orthogonal signal among each other? How can the receiver distinguish the received signals for each UAV? I think the authors should give more reasonable assumptions and descriptions for the system model.\r\n2.   Where is your dataset description in section IV on page 4? I just see the subtitle but without content. I guess it is summarized in TABLE II. The author should check the paper carefully.\r\n3. The authors only test the input system with five antennas. What about the performance with less or more antennas. Moreover, the number of NLOS paths is 6, which is fixed. What about the performance for less or more NLOS paths.\r\n4. What is the exact definition for epsilon under eq. 5?\r\n5. In this work, many parts, including the residual connectivity, ReLU activation, the convolution operation, as well as the normalization, are basically common knowledge for deep learning. There is no need to explain the details in such a large space.\r\n6. There are many errors in the paper. For example, the SNR shown in table is -20dB \\div 20dB. What is the meaning of \\div? The comma in eq. 9, 10,11 should be changed to a period. Once again, please check the whole paper carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\n<b>ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR</b>:\r\nFollowing are some of my major comments on the manuscript:\r\n1. The main motivation of using neural networks for DoA estimation is not clear at all. Just because deep learning is a hot topic doesn&#39;t automatically justify the use of it for anything.\r\n\r\n2. There are very sophisticated (and their low-complexity versions) for DoA estimation techniques that have been developed over decades of fundamental research. In this paper there are no comparison with these legacy DoA estimation techniques.\r\n\r\n3. I firmly believe that classic DoA estimation methods such as ESPRIT, MUSIC would easily outperform the proposed DNN based approach and with very low computational complexity.\r\n\r\n4.  No discussion is provided on training procedure. How will the data be collected?\r\n\r\n5. Say the training is somehow done. Now how to make sure that training setup is similar to the real environment test setup (with high chance, they won&#39;t be same)?\r\n\r\nDate Sent:\r\n\r\n30-Nov-2020", "write_date": "2020-12-01T12:17:25Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.134.87", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 349, "fields": {"subject": "Godwin Brown Tunze, Thien Huynh-The, Jae-Min Lee, and Dong-Seong Kim, “Sparsely Connected CNN for Ef&#64257;cient Automatic Modulation Recognition,” IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology", "content": "Dear Prof. Kim:\r\n\r\nI am pleased to inform you that your paper:\r\n\r\nVT-2020-02150.R1: Sparsely Connected CNN for Efficient Automatic Modulation Recognition\r\n\r\nhas been accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology.\r\n\r\nAttached below are comments from the reviewers which should be considered when returning your manuscript in its final form.

I regret to inform you that based on the enclosed reviews and my own reading of your manuscript, I am unable to recommend its publication in IEEE Wireless Communications Letters.\r\n\r\nYour paper may not be resubmitted for review. After careful consideration submitted by the reviewers and my own reading, I cannot recommend the acceptance of this manuscript for publication in IEEE WCL. The main reasons are as follows:\r\n1) The first reason is that, as Reviewer 1 pointed out, the proposed learning network requires more parameters than the other networks. A slight change in those parameters may significantly affect the performance of the proposed network. Judging from the manuscript, the parameters are trained by the dataset that does not change over time. Unfortunately, it is impractical to have such a large number of datasets.\r\n2) The second reason is that the effectiveness of the proposed method is unclear. Fig. 2 shows that the training loss becomes smaller as an epoch proceeds. The performance of the proposed network (SRTL-CSI) shows little improvement compared to the performance at epoch 0. The authors should clearly explain that phenomenon.\r\n3) The third reason is that it is unclear how and why the proposed network can improve performance. The manuscript implies that the application of transfer learning can improve performance. However, the rationale behind that claim is not theoretically validated. It is just shown by computer simulation. It means that the proposed network may not be able to improve the performance under different scenarios.\r\n4) The last reason is that the manuscript needs careful revision in order to make it easily read. Especially the introduction part is complicated. It is not clear what is the main contribution of this manuscript and what has been done by the other researchers before.\r\n\r\nAdditional comments include:\r\n\r\nThe reviewers&#39; comments are found at the end of this email.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting your work to the IEEE Wireless Communications Letters. I hope the outcome of this specific submission will not discourage you from the submission of future manuscripts.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDr. Koichi Adachi\r\nEditor, IEEE Wireless Communications Letters\r\nadachi@awcc.uec.ac.jp\r\n\r\nReviewer: 1\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe reviewer appreciates the authors for revisions; however, my major concern is still not addressed in the revised paper.\r\n\r\nThe authors lack a rational explanation about why transfer learning can improve the reconstruction accuracy. They just proved its effectiveness by simulation results. Since the proposed network is deeper (more parameters and more epochs for SRCNN training) compared with CsiNet, the improvement is understandable; however, we cannot understand that the improvement causes by transfer learning. To claim the contribution, the authors should give a rational explanation.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper develops a deep learning based CSI reconstruction scheme for MIMO systems. I have some comments as follows.\r\n1. Is the proposed decoder scheme suitable for any encoder design or only the one used in this work?\r\n2. Does the split of super resolution require a higher online or offline complexity?\r\n3. The format of references needs to be double checked, e.g., &#39;mimo&#39;, &#39;csi&#39;, &#39;fdd&#39; should be in the upper case.\r\n4. The literature review is suggested to be enhanced by citing more relevant works such as\r\n[1] “MIMO channel information feedback using deep recurrent network,” IEEE Communications Letters, vol. 23, no. 1, pp. 188&#8211;191, Jan. 2019.", "write_date": "2020-12-15T14:50:12Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "112.217.167.202", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 351, "fields": {"subject": "", "content": "You have amazing content.I have gathered lots of knowledge.Kindly check out my site if you need the <a href=\"https://www.nursingcasestudy.org/writers/\">Best Nursing Case study writing service</a> and have an experience with our professional writers.\r\n\r\n", "write_date": "2020-12-16T04:28:37Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "41.139.223.250", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 352, "fields": {"subject": "Gabriel Amaizu, Danielle Agron, Jae-Min Lee, Dong-Seong Kim &#34;Hybrid Deep Neural Network for Malicious DNS Infiltration Detection System&#34; WCNC2021 (REJECTED)", "content": "Dear Mr. Amaizu,\r\n\r\nWe regret to inform you that your paper #1570690831, &#39;Hybrid Deep Neural Network for Malicious DNS Infiltration Detection System&#39;, has not been accepted for presentation at the IEEE WCNC 2021 Track 1 &#8211; Phy & Fundamentals.\r\n\r\nThe conference received a very high number of submissions and was thus very competitive.

In the title, abstract, and Section I, the authors described the work as related to domain name system (DNS) over HTTPS (DoH).  However, it was unclear why the proposed deep neural network (DNN) architecture is appropriate for this problem. In Sections II and III, the authors did not justify the use of some of the parameters in the proposed architecture.\r\n\r\n2) In the 4th paragraph in Section I, the authors mentioned that the proposed approach is based on unsupervised learning. However, in Section II.B, the authors used labeled dataset [8] for training.\r\n\r\n3) Reference [8] was incomplete. The authors did not provide the name of the journal or conference proceedings.   \r\n\r\n4) Although the authors compared the proposed scheme with Malportrait [6], Malportrait was not a state of the art technique. The authors should compare their proposed scheme with other algorithms.\r\n\r\n> *** Recommended Changes: Recommended changes. Please indicate any changes that should be made to the paper if accepted.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the comments in the &#34;Weak Aspects&#34; section.

(2)\r\n\r\n======= WCNC Review 2 =======\r\n\r\n> *** Strong Aspects: Comments to the author: What are the strong aspects of the paper?\r\n\r\nThere is no strong aspects in this submission. Only the topic itself is interesting. Detection of DoH attacks (and DNS attacks) in general is a valid and important research problem.\r\n\r\n> *** Weak Aspects: Comments to the author: What are the weak aspects of the paper?\r\n\r\nThe paper is superficial and poorly written. From little that is understandable, the authors just apply well known learning techniques offline on a publicly available data set. The methodology is poorly justified and full of unexplained &#34;magic numbers&#34;. Why 3 convolution layers, and why not more or less? Why 128, 64 and 32 neurons in each? Why is the learning rate set to 0.001? Why (1), (2) and (3) and are there some other functions that result in even better performance?\r\n\r\nEven the abstract contains broken and unintelligible sentences. Word &#34;attacks&#34; is missing twice. The introduction contains numerous grammar errors.\r\n\r\n> *** Recommended Changes: Recommended changes. Please indicate any changes that should be made to the paper if accepted.\r\n\r\nThe study needs to be performed more thoroughly. There must be a formal model that leads to selection of optimum parameters for the convolutional network. This optimization of the CNN should be the gist of the work. The evaluation should be performed on diverse datasets, and even implemented on a real domain server. It must be clear whether the approach is implementable in real life and can it detect attacks in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n> *** Relevance and Timeliness: Rate the importance and timeliness of the topic addressed in the paper within its area of research.\r\nGood.

(1)\r\n\r\n======= WCNC Review 3 =======\r\n\r\n> *** Strong Aspects: Comments to the author: What are the strong aspects of the paper?\r\n\r\nTo improve the security, an unsupervised hybrid machine learning model is proposed for early detection and classification of benign and malicious DoH. The proposed scheme incorporates the swiftness of convolutional neural network (CNN) in extracting useful information and the ease of long short-term memory (LSTM) in learning long-term dependencies. From the simulation results, the proposed scheme was found to accurately classify benign and malicious DoH CNN, with an accuracy, precision and recall rate of 99.49\\%, 99.23\\% and 99.75\\% respectively. Also, the model was compared to other contemporary algorithms.\r\n\r\n> *** Weak Aspects: Comments to the author: What are the weak aspects of the paper?\r\n\r\n1. The proposed method is simple and no mathematical analysis is provided.\r\n2. The simulation results are not enough to show the performance of the proposed method.\r\n3. CNN and LSTM are two classical deep learning methods. The application of them in DNS security is interesting. However, the motivation of doing this is not well explained.\r\n4. The writing of this paper should be further improved.\r\n\r\n> *** Recommended Changes: Recommended changes. Please indicate any changes that should be made to the paper if accepted.\r\n\r\n1.

The envisioned solutions has been evaluated by means of an industry recognized dataset.\r\n\r\nIn general, the paper is well-structured and the motivations as well the methodology are clear.\r\n\r\nHowever, some concerns must be addressed before publication:\r\n\r\n* In Section 2, the authors should specofy the difference in their methodology (e.g., adopted algorithms) with respect to existing solutions. Moreover, the Reviewer suggests to cite the following related paper: &#34;Miorandi et al, REATO: REActing TO denial of service attacks in the Internet of Things. Computer Networks: 137: 37-48 (2018)&#34;.\r\n* Sections 3.2 and 3.6 could be mergefd together.\r\n* Please try to refer to 5G components/network in Section 3, mainly with respect to Figure 3, which should represent the system model.\r\n* In Section 4, the authors must specify the features of the considered network for simulation, in order to infer about scalability. More in detail, it is not clear how the chosen dataset has been practically used.\r\n* Please check for some English mistakes, such as &#34;When a user equipment (UE) send&#34; should be &#34;When a user equipment (UE) sends&#34;. In general, please carefully check che first part of Section 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #2: The manuscript entitled &#34;Composite and Efficient DDoS Attack Detection Framework for B5G Networks&#34; discuss is some of the most interesting aspects related to secure communication in the context of 5G and beyond networks.\r\nDespite the work carried out by the authors, the contribution has some weak points that must be addressed before the manuscript can be accepted for publication.\r\n\r\nOverall opinion:\r\nThe way acronyms are introduced and used is misleading. In particular, the proper way to introduce an acronym is with the extended form i.e., Artificial Intelligence, followed by the short form, i.e., AI. From that point on, only the short form should be used. The comment must be conceived as a general consideration and addresses the proposed manuscript as a whole.\r\nThe quality of all the images presented is unacceptable for a journal, in general, even more so for one of this level. While Figures should provide further insight and a clarification of the proposed concepts, those presented in this work do not achieve at all such goals.\r\nThe authors should consider reporting measurement units behind square brackets. The Reviewer would like to point out that when a measurement unit is a pure number, the graph should report &#34;[#]&#34;.\r\nWhen reporting numbers and their measurement units, there may be a space between the two, or not. The two approaches are both correct since they are used uniformly throughout the whole work. The authors are advised to review the manuscript accordingly.\r\nIt is worth noting that the paper does not always follow template rules in terms of spacing and indentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetailed comments:\r\nIn the Introduction:\r\nThe Y axis of figure 2 is unclear. It represents a percentage of what?\r\n\r\nIn Section II:\r\nAt the end of the introduction of this section, the authors argued that changes in topology may lead to an inefficient evaluation of possible attacks. Nevertheless, it is not clear if attackers are properly moving in order to change network topology or not. If it was so, there could be a pattern to be learned, and this could be used. If not, it is unclear what is causing movements, how many changes in topology are verified and out to study them.\r\nIt is quite odd to see only one subsection. Indeed, the subdivision is not needed since the authors envision artificial intelligence as a solution to the aforedescribed problems.\r\n\r\nIn Section III:\r\nFigures 5 and 6 should be reviewed. The former reports some unclear measurement units on the Y axis. The ladder, instead, simply presents the way a data set can be split. Nevertheless, the figure doesn&#39;t add anything to a single sentence on the same topic. The authors should clarify the rationale for the choice instead of reporting useless figures.\r\n\r\nIn Section IV:\r\nFigure 9 should be improved in quality.\r\nAt the end of the section, the authors should consider clarifying what the lessons learned are.\r\n\r\nIn Conclusions:\r\nFuture works are poorly discussed.\r\n\r\nAs for the references:\r\nAs for the references, the way references are reported should be the same for each of them. The authors should double-check the whole section.", "write_date": "2020-12-29T10:33:18Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "112.149.111.66", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 354, "fields": {"subject": "Alifia Putri Anantha, Muhammad Rusyadi Ramli, Jae-Min Lee, and Dong-Seong Kim, &#34;Deep Reinforcement Learning with Edge Computing in Faulty-Node Detection for Industrial Internet of Things&#34;, ICT Express, 2020 (Rejected)", "content": "Manuscript Number: ICTE-D-20-00040 &#8239; \r\n\r\nDeep Reinforcement Learning with Edge Computing in Faulty-Node Detection for Industrial Internet of Things \r\n\r\nDear Professor Kim,\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting your manuscript to ICT Express. \r\n\r\nI regret to inform you that the reviewers recommend against publishing your manuscript, and I must therefore reject it.

Other contributions claimed include &#39;reduce the processing time and network latency&#39;, and faulty-node-detection accuracy.\r\n\r\nHowever, the first and foremost concern I have for the paper is unclarity of the problem definition, and why RL is necessary. The 4-page paper dedicates 1.5 pages for the background knowledge of MDP and RL, without linking it to the problem to be solved by the paper. Further excluding some space for title/author and references, the remaining content of the paper failed to convey what is unique and novel about the proposed research. It need to clearly define what type of fault for IOT nodes the paper want to detect, without which, it is really hard to see why a simple rule or heuristics-based approach, e.g. by checking the battery level reported, cannot solve the problem.\r\n\r\nBesides, the paper is also lacking the details about what is the metrics for evaluating, although it claims it deliver better accuracy, reliability reduced time and latency, than traditional approaches. I didn&#39;t see clearly how the evaluations is done, and where are the comparisons with the traditional approaches.\r\n\r\nIn short, a suggestion is to clearly define the problem, clearly present how the defined problem is modeled using in the RL approach. And a detailed description of the evaluations and comparisons with the baseline are needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #2: The authors study the problem of faulty node detection for industrial Internet of things by leveraging the technologies affects computing and the deep reinforcement learning mechanism. The provided theoretical analysis is concrete, complete, and correct. The authors have well thought out their main contributions and the manuscript is overall well written. The authors should consider the following comments in order to improve the quality of presentation of their manuscript, as well as some suggestions by the reviewer in order to improve the scientific depth of the manuscript.\r\n\r\n1. Initially, prospect theory has been introduced in the literature, such as Vamvakas, P., et al. &#34;Exploiting prospect theory and risk-awareness to protect UAV-assisted network operation.&#34; EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking 2019.1 (2019): 286, in order to detect faulty nodes within a wireless communications system. Furthermore, machine learning approaches, such as Huang, Xin-Lin, Xiaomin Ma, and Fei Hu. &#34;Machine learning and intelligent communications.&#34; Mobile Networks and Applications 23.1 (2018): 68-70, have been also exploited in order to detect faulty nodes within a wireless sensor network. The authors are encouraged to discuss those two different types of approaches that have been introduced in the literature on top of the one examined in this paper.\r\n\r\n2. In section 3, the authors should provide some more detailed theoretical discussion regarding the adopted deep reinforcement learning mechanism. The current provided discussion is very limited in order to enable the reader to reproduce the provided theoretical analysis.\r\n\r\n3. In section 4, the authors should provide some indicative numerical results showing the real execution time of the proposed framework and discuss its potential to be applied in real time or even close to real-time manner in a real industrial Internet of things environment.\r\n\r\n4. In section 4, the authors should provide a scalability analysis in order to show the scalability and robustness of the proposed framework in a real industrial Internet of things environment.\r\n\r\n5. Finally, the overall manuscript should be checked for typos, syntax, and grammar errors in order to improve the quality of its presentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #3: In this paper, the authors claim that they propose a novel faulty-node-detection scheme for IIoT that leverages edge computing and deep reinforcement learning (DRL); edge computing is used to reduce the processing time and network latency by\r\nperforming a DRL task.

Performance and simulation discussion need much more detail as to what is included (e.g., SNR, motion, etc). No discussion of generalized behavior learning suggest the solution is brittle.\r\n- Given you are operating int he 2.4 GHz ISM band, need to describe the conditions of other interfering signals in the spectrum; if none, that limits the extensibility of the observed performance.\r\n- Figures appear largely out of place in the document\r\n- Looking at figure 3/Table 3, the results appear &#34;too&#34; good. How have you ensured that you are not over-fitting? Why continue beyond epoch ~50?\r\n- What SNR are you operating? This looks to be the case for an extremely high SNR. How does the performance degrade as function of SNR.\r\n- Figure 4/5: the abrupt changes in accuracy / loss measurements suggest overfitting\r\nPaper needs a thorough proof-reading: page 2 (&#34;illegal&#39;s&#34;), page 2/3 (paragraph &#34;In addition...&#34;), commas before clauses, ensure acronyms are spelled out (&#34;NBC&#34;), etc\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #2: 1. Original Submission\r\n1.1. Recommendation\r\nMajor Revision\r\n2. Comments to Author:\r\nMr. Ref. No.: COMNET-D-20-00771\r\nTitle: Convolution Neural Network Inspired Surveillance System for UAVs Detection and Identification\r\nOverview and general recommendation:\r\nInformation security of aviation is very important to city management. Modelling an identification of UAVs in RF is still a great challenge. Due to its spatial and temporal variability, classifying UAVs in RF is looked upon to be a good tool for modelling an identification of UAVs.\r\nThe authors presented a convolution neural network based on surveillance system for drone detection and identification namely CNN-SSDI. The network architecture is designed based on the deep convolution layers to successively learn intrinsic feature maps of radio-frequency signals that are collected from three different types of drones. The authors performed careful and thorough modeling and training processing.\r\nOn the other hand, this study should add more experiments. It is recommended the type of UAVs increased to 5 or more. The description of the experiment should be more detailed, and the authors should show some insights about why the proposed method achieves the better accuracy than other methods. Furthermore, the study needs to be reorganized. Some paragraphs are too long and the position of the diagrams is not appropriate, resulting in low readability.\r\n\r\n2.1. Major comments:\r\n1. Page 3, Lines 5-6. The author claims that it is a feasible way to obtain signals by RF. The authors should provide a feasible reason or cite literature to support this argument.\r\n2. The author should reorganize Section 2. The methods of related works in this section should be segmented to increase readability.\r\n\r\n3. Section 3 and Section 5. The authors should present more detail of the data collection. What kind of sequences did the authors collect? Completely random? If possible, show some examples.\r\n\r\n4. Section 4. Is the proposed system only suitable for identifying with three types of drones? If the recognized types are increased to 5, what is the performance of the model?\r\n\r\n5. Section 4. The authors should show not only iteration, but also other parameter setting such as learning rate and dropout.\r\n\r\n6. Section 4. A detailed description of Fig. 4 is necessary.\r\n\r\n7. Section 4. How long does the model run 200 epochs? If the running time is too long, it is not efficient to retrain/update the recognition model.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Section 5.3. Regarding the processing of time series problems with deep learning models, LSTM is often applied. Authors should compare the results with it.\r\n\r\n9. Section 5.3. The authors should show some insights about why the proposed method achieves the better accuracy than other methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.2. Minor comments:\r\n10. The position of the picture should be adjusted to increase readability.\r\nFor example:\r\nThe text description of Table 2 is on page 13, but the table is listed on page 6.\r\nThe text description of Fig. 1 is on page 8, but the figure is on page 4.\r\n\r\n11. Section 5.1. Is the deep learning (CNN) implemented by python library? The authors should explain more detail about the implementation. If possible, show the references.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n*****\r\nWe invite you to convert your supplementary data (or a part of it) into an additional journal publication in Data in Brief, a multi-disciplinary open access journal.

Moreover, the authors also claimed that the proposed hybrid network architecture improves the communication security. Overall, the submitted manuscript does not provide any mathematical proof or equation that clarifies how the proposed system is able to achieve the claimed points. For more detailed comments, please see below.\r\n1) &#34;Reducing acknowledgment/feedback processing time&#34;: As only one technology (UWB) is used for the uplink transmission, this statement doesn&#39;t sound correct. Most of the acknowledgment and feedback signals are sent from UE/robot to BS/AP - so there is a bottleneck on the uplink transmission which will be the problematic for the proposed hybrid network.\r\n2) There is no introduction regarding UWB. Why did you choose UWB? What is the motivation for considering UWB instead of any other RF technology? UWB also requires LoS link in order to have a reliable link performance. Thus, a clear motivation should be provided on considering UWB as the hybrid network part for VLC.\r\n3) There are several statements that need justification. Few of these statements are as follows:\r\n(i) &#34;But the up-link is not efficient as upward illumination is not necessary and energy inefficient&#34;: this statement is not correct. You are not using visible light for the uplink, it is a infra-red link and it does not require illumination. So, it does not affect the energy efficiency etc.\r\n(ii) &#34;Other authors in [22] proposed the use of infrared for up-link and VLC for down-link, which did not have the problems associated peculiar with [16], but has limited data rate for up-link and worked in small LoS.&#34;: the referred paper can be considered as outdated as several recently published studies have provided more in-depth analysis for VLC uplink. Moreover, there are few VLC/LiFi products available in the market that achieves <40 Mbps for both uplink and downlink transmission.\r\n(iii) &#34;However, the paper focused on outdoor environments as against the idea of indoor scenarios in this paper.&#34;: This is not correct. The paper surveyed indoor and outdoor scenarios.\r\n(iv) &#34;Following the four steps significantly delay the arrival of the acknowledgment.&#34;: what is the other AP here? Is it non-VLC network element? It is not clear why there is a delay on acknowledgment.\r\n(v) &#34;Fig. 5 shows an example of how one cluster of LEDs can be inadequate for a warehouse.&#34;: The figure does not represent a realistic scenario as with the given LED distribution, there will be no or too little light/illumination on the position where the robot is shown. So, it will be a dark area in the warehouse. No need to show/discuss using single LED in such a big warehouse as it won&#39;t provide the required illumination level at all.\r\n(vi) &#34;The mechanism is incorporated to detect when one of the network is hack.&#34;: It is not clear how do you detect the network is hacked. If you can detect it there will be no problem, the actual problem is that the network is not aware of an eavesdropper.\r\n4) Overall, the paper needs a major work on the language and organization of the paper. The abstract is composed of disconnected sentences. It is not easy to understand the contribution of the paper from the abstract. Also, there are lots of grammatical errors. At some parts, there is a sudden change from description given for VLC to UWB.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nIn this paper, the author presents a hybrid RF-VCL network structure in which UWB technology has been adopted as bi-directional RF access.  The work is interesting, but anything is new. The VLC channel model is classic LOS-NLOS channel model. The simulation results on VLC channel are too optimal.  I did see any mechanism or processing about hybrid network with the combination of VLC and UWB.  and I don&#39;t see any discussion detailed about the security with choice of constituent network technologies that you mentioned at the beginning of your paper.   I think it has not enough novel points and not enough results for our journal of communications and networks.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper proposes a combination of VLC and UWB for a network used in logistics.\r\n\r\nMain concern: in Fig. 10 and the text, an SNR of 1350 dB is described. This has to be a mistake, and you should know that 1350dB is not a plausible value for any SNR!\r\n\r\nAnother problem not discussed in the paper is the fact that the UWB communication which is used for the uplink is prone to NLOS situations (especially in a warehouse with shelves, etc). In these cases, the acknowledgement does not arrive at the network. How is this handled in Algorithm 1?\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 6, the LED coverage area is shown. If I see it correctly, there are spots without coverage. How does that influence the algorithms?\r\n\r\nIn general, the introduction is too long compared to the main part of the paper (there are 5 columns of introduction, which is about the length of the rest of the paper). Furthermore, proof reading of the manuscript is necessary (Math in text if often wrong, e.g., tau without \\,  foc and fof without subscript, etc.).", "write_date": "2021-01-27T12:46:21Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.134.216", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 360, "fields": {"subject": "Real-time Optimizations in Energy Profiles and End-to-End Delay in WSN for IoT Applications , Elsevier Computer Communications  (IF: 2.816), (S)", "content": "Manuscript Number: COMCOM_2020_898R2 &#8239;\r\n\r\nReal-time Optimizations in Energy Profiles and End-to-End Delay in WSN using Two-hop Information &#8239;\r\n\r\nDear Professor Kim,\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting your manuscript to Computer Communications. \r\n\r\nI am pleased to inform you that your manuscript has been accepted for publication. &#8239; \r\n\r\nMy comments, and any reviewer comments, are below.&#8239; &#8239;  \r\nYour accepted manuscript will now be transferred to our production department.

Besides, the paper is not well written.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewers&#39; Comments to the Authors:\r\n\r\nReviewer: 1\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper entitled “NM500: An Artificial Intelligence Chip Based on Neuromorphic Technology” presents the Neuromorphic chip NM500, suitable for developing many different artificial intelligence tasks. The authors present accuracy data related to the EMNIST dataset and compare the obtained results to other CNNs as AlexNet, VGGNet and GoogleNet. The paper tackles a trending topic in the research line of artificial intelligence, which is the hardware implementation of neuromorphic networks that could outperform GPUs and CPUs in terms of classification accuracy, energy efficiency and speed. However, the statements claimed by the authors are not properly explained and justified. The paper needs major revisions, but it could be suitable for publication after the correction of the following points:\r\n\r\n1. The writing style of the paper should be slightly modified since some information provided by the authors are more suitable for an informative article than a scientific one (e. g. economic data and stakeholders instead of giving technical quantitative data and references).\r\n2. Revise the particle “Neuro…” as many times the authors have written “Nuero…”. Correct other English mistakes (e. g. Line 52, page 3: “The EMNIST dataset is a balanced and improvement …”).\r\n3. It is absolutely not clear how the authors have performed the comparison among AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogleNet and NM500. In addition, the authors do not include any experimental data or theory that could support the results presented. The accuracy data presented and the sentences “the system outperforms …” should be properly justified, explaining more in depth the architecture of the network (layers? MLP? CNN?), the kind of neuromorphic technology employed (supervised? unsupervised? SNN + maxpooling?) and, obviously, the technical novelties introduced by this new network (hardware implemented?) that make it so interesting.\r\n4. “Parallel architecture” does not exactly imply “scalable”.\r\n5. Explain the difference between “accuracy per image” and “accuracy per character”. Does not each image represent a different character?\r\n6. References are poor.\r\n7. Figures could be highly improved (e. g. Fig. 1 shows a book, or sheets below the boards).\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper does not contain any circuit or system level contribution. The provided material is good for a project report or a data sheet. Following main points are missing in the presented manuscript:\r\na) Overview is not a contribution of the work\r\nb) Demonstrating performance without detailing circuit or system level design also is not contribution.\r\nc) (Very important) To further improve the quality of the manuscript, it is crucial to make technical comparisons with state-of-the-art works. The overview, description, results, discussion, conclusion section do not make ANY comparison with the existing works. Also, it would be much better if quantitative comparison are made. A comparison table for the measurement results with state-of-the-art works will be good addition.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nTCAS-II-08909-2020 NM500: An Artificial Intelligence Chip Based on Neuromorphic Technology\r\n\r\nThis paper claims to present a framework to deploy an AI accelerator chip NM500 for general AI applications with evaluation results. The authors provide an overview along with some implementation details. Generally, it is useful for this community to know more about the use of NM500 through reading this manuscript. However, this paper is not well suited with the scope of TCAS2, because of the following concerns:\r\n\r\n1. This paper is lack of novelty. The use of the existing chip NM500 for accelerating the NN computing is not new, as is already presented in the NM500 website. As I could understand, essential materials are provided mainly in Section III (implementation) and Section IV (results). However, there is no clear comparison between this work and others in terms of implementation novelty, which is critical to understand the key advances over existing designs.\r\n\r\n2. This paper is lack of support. The authors claim NM500 applications, which include, quote, “finds ready application in surveillance, face recognition, industrial inspection and control, laser marking, and smart systems”. However, the evaluation results were only based on EMNIST, which is a rather low-complexity scenario compared with other tasks.\r\n\r\n3. This paper is not well written.

However, PV management may be subject to serious penalties due to the unsteadiness pattern of photovoltaic output power that depends on solar radiation. A high-precision LSTM based neural network model named SIPNet to predict solar irradiance in a short time interval is proposed to overcome this problem. Solar irradiation depends on the environmental sensing of meteorological information such as temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and direction, which are different dimensions in measurement. LSTM neural networks can concurrently learn the spatiotemporal of multivariate input features via various logistic gates. Moreover, SIPNet can estimate the future solar irradiance given the historical observation of the meteorological information and the radiation data. The SIPNet model is simulated and compared with the actual and predicted data series and evaluated by the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The empirical results show that the value of MAE, MSE, and RMSE of SIPNet is 0.0413, 0.0033, and 0.057, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of SIPNet and outperforms other existing models.

Generally, there is not enough contribution. The feature selection scheme to mitigate the curse of dimensionality has been extensively studied. The most parts of the paper introduce the background and related works. The contributions are missing even in the introduction section. The authors also set important parameters, i.e., heuristic threshold, as fixed value, making it difficult for reproduce of the experiments. The reviewers also raised major concerns on the writing issues, the experimental settings, and the explanation of algorithms.\r\n\r\n&#8226; Reviewer Comments, if any, are listed below:\r\n\r\nReviewer: 1\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nIn this paper, a hybrid filter for feature extraction is proposed to reduce the computational complexity and improve the detection accuracy. In this paper, important features are extracted by chi-square and redundancy calculation. The experimental results show that the efficiency and precision of DDoS attack detection are improved by using the filtered features. However, this paper has the following problems:\r\n1. Why set the heuristic threshold at -0.8? How did this number come about?\r\n2. In Algorithm 1, why are features whose importance level attribute is lower than threshold P retained?\r\n3. Some close related works, especially the new and important DDoS attack detection schemes should be reviewed, such as “A DDoS attack detection and mitigation with software-defined Internet of Things framework”, “DDoS Detection and Defense Mechanism Based on Cognitive-Inspired Computing in SDN”, “TDDAD: Time-Based Detection and Defense Scheme Against DDoS Attack on SDN Controller” and “Privacy-preserving DDoS attack detection using cross-domain traffic in software defined networks”.\r\n4. Spelling errors are common throughout the paper, as are the descriptions in some of the figure.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nIn this paper authors discuss a DDoS attack detection framework which involves the impact of curse of dimensionality. They discussed on elimination of redundant and highly correlated features followed by a wrapperbased feature ranking by importance. However, a few concerns in the paper.\r\n\r\n1. The major contributions of the paper are missing in the Introduction section. The related work can be improved in the direction of the proposed work.\r\n2. Few typos are in the paper. For example, “only relevant parameters with high discriminative power are retained wile redundant/irrelevant parameters are discarded.”\r\n\r\nWith reference to Eq.2 , please check and correct this sentence “It makes use of the euclidean distance formula given in Eq. (2) o makes i prediction. This algorithm is quite simple and comes with very love computational costs”\r\n\r\nCheck Eq.3, X and Y must be subscript.\r\n1. Check Eq 4, stat and end index are missing. For measuring the accuracy of the model, it is essential to provide an accuracy equation.\r\n2. With referring to the first line, Section IV (B). It seems very confusing. Equ 1. Bayse Theorem but the authors claim is different.\r\n3. Algorithm 1 has not been properly explained. A stepwise explanation is much needed. Also, it must ensure, why the significance level and correlation threshold are selected as 0.05 and 0.9 respectively?\r\n4. For proper evaluation sharing the dataset is essential.\r\n5. Related to Feature set comparison with other datasets and CICD dataset is essential. Since feature selection is the major contribution of the paper. Since these data collected during the era of 5G, what are the extra feature, these new datasets contain?\r\n6. Authors may consider few recent articles related to DDOS detection and feature selection.\r\n\r\na.

The paper is well written, clear and easy to read. However, I think there is no significant contribution.\r\n\r\nAll the provided information is known, and nothing new is provided.\r\n\r\nUsing one dataset in the experiments is not enough to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method.\r\n\r\nThere is no comparison with other feature selection methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: If any of the reviews include an additional attached file, it will not be attached to this message.

In the current version, a few additional recommendations:\r\n- Given you are operating at high SNR, please be explicit when making comparisons to prior work. Most prior works use SNRs in the range of ~10-15 dB, whereas 30 dB is not a fair comparison. The range of SNR is also relevant since generalization of learned behaviors is sensitive to those changes. This context is relevant to both the abstract, the conclusions (now incorporated), and the primary text. E.g., are you setting the proper expectations in the abstract when you give performance figures? are you fairly comparing performance in Table 8?\r\n- The confusion matrices in Fig 5 and 10 still have numbers that are far too small to read. Recommend eliminating scientific notation and increasing font size within confusion matrices ~3x. You can make better use of the white space to avoid expanding the actual image size.\r\n- Paper still needs a thorough proof-reading for English language usage. E.g., &#34;Despite attracting wider attention in diverse utilization, UAVs has illegal&#39;s abused in privacy disclosure, ...&#34;\r\n\r\nReviewer #2: All my comments are satisfied, I think this paper is suitable for publication.\r\n&#8239; &#8239;", "write_date": "2021-04-22T13:19:09Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.134.87", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 370, "fields": {"subject": "Agron, Danielle Jaye, Lee, Jae-Min, Kim, Dong-Seong, &#34;Nozzle Thermal Estimation for Fused Filament Fabricating 3D Printer using Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks&#34; Applied Sciences", "content": "Dear Professor Lee,\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting the following manuscript to Applied Sciences:\r\n\r\nManuscript ID: applsci-1200453\r\nType of manuscript: Article\r\nTitle: Nozzle Thermal Estimation for Fused Filament Fabricating 3D Printer\r\nusing Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks\r\nAuthors: Danielle Jaye Segui Agron *, Jae-Min Lee *, Dong-Seong Kim *\r\nReceived: 12 April 2021\r\nE-mails: danielleagron@kumoh.ac.kr, ljmpaul@kumoh.ac.kr, dskim@kumoh.ac.kr\r\nSubmitted to section: Mechanical Engineering,\r\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci/sections/mechanical_engineering\r\nAdvanced Manufacturing Technologies and Their Applications\r\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci/special_issues/Advanced_Manufacturing_Technologies\r\n\r\nIt has been reviewed by experts in the field and we request that you make\r\nmajor revisions before it is processed further.

Add more research and compare the main pros and cons of other estimation techniques and other ANNs (as NARX , for example consider to include the following work that evaluates different kinds of ANNs: \r\nBonfitto, A., Feraco, S., Tonoli, A., Amati, N., & Monti, F. (2019). Estimation accuracy and computational cost analysis of artificial neural networks for state of charge estimation in lithium batteries. Batteries, 5(2), 47.) Also please include a comparison to other works in current literature to highlight your  \r\n\r\n2 - the experimental data is quite poor. The validation and training data are too similar. Try to present also another case for validation.\r\n\r\n3 - A picture of the used hardware setup is useful for the reader. Consider to include it in the paper.\r\n\r\n4 - An image of the actually estimated temperature versus the &#34;target&#34; one is needed. The indication about the error only is not sufficient to prove the results.\r\nReviewer 2:\r\nThis manuscript proposes a temporal convolutional network with a two-stage sliding window strategy (TCN-TS-SW) to predict the temperature of nozzle in a Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing process. The results demonstrate that he proposed methodology can predict the temperature more accurately than other existing machine learning models. This is a theoretical paper, but the proposed methodology could be embedded in a closed loop system to control the temperature of the nozzle, one of the process parameters.\r\nSome issues and recommendations are listed below.\r\n1. What can the authors present about current nozzle temperature control systems? What are their drawbacks?\r\n2. The failure of a 3D printed product can have multiple causes, individual or combined. How do the authors establish that a possible failure is due to temperature?\r\n3. Although the paper is not focused on the experiment, the experimental section should be presented in more detail, including pictures of the equipment.\r\n4. The paper mentions the proposed strategy can serve to build a predictive maintenance system. The authors should clearly state, the proposed strategy is dedicated to a predictive maintenance system or can be used to prevent the thermal degradation of the printed components. These are two totally different problems.\r\n5. Figure 3. Why the temperature varies, except for the slight fluctuations?\r\n6. What does the “Accuracy” in Figures 4(b) and 5(b) mean?\r\n\r\nReviewer 3:\r\nThe idea may be of interest. However, the paper does not contain sufficient technical information as a journal paper. \r\nReviewer 4:\r\nThe subject of the work is remarkable, but it is necessary that\r\nsome parts are detailed.\r\nFirst of all, the use of the algorithm you have developed is not yet\r\na system for maintenance (as stated in lines 50 and 63), although it could be an essential element. Currently, the system stops the operations (line 72) in the case in which the forecast detects an &#34;anomalous trend&#34; of the expected temperature values. This countermeasure is not conclusive, as it blocks the production process and does not guarantee that, due to this interruption, the product will be free of defects at the end of the process.\r\nFinally, the activation of the fan (line 105) prevents a possible degradation of the product, but not of the production plant.\r\nIt would then be better to explain the symbols of equation (1): if m_l is a quantity that depends on the layer (indexed by l), it is not clear how R_b can be independent of l. The vector d (formed by l elements) does not appear in equation (1).\r\nThe statement that R^2 is between 0 and 1 (line 151) would appear to be incorrect. In the definition of R^2 used in Python at the address https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html\r\nR^2 can become less than 0, even less than -1.\r\nTherefore, it would be clearer to report after equation (3) the definition of R^2 you used.\r\nThe values shown in table 1 have no validity from a statistical point of view. If you try to train the neural network again by choosing another training subset from the actual dataset; or acquire another dataset by printing another specimen, how much will vary the values shown in the table? This information is quite significant because the difference between the values obtained using the two methods under comparison is only a few thousandths (2 for RMSE, 9 for MAE, 4 for R^2). It would be significant to provide confidence intervals for the nine results to show that they are disjoint and that the variations between the values shown in table 1 are not due to a statistical fluctuation.\r\nFurthermore, the method you have developed seems to perform better (albeit slightly) if the sample produced is Type I of the standard.

The Malicious Activity Classification is important but the author does not clearly the research. 1) From the Technical point of view, this paper does not give more details about Algorithm and formula, rather than it looks like a report about the framework of Smart Industrial Factory. How to collect data? How to handle data? They are all missing. 2) The core method in section III SYSTEM MODEL is not clear. For my opinion, this section should show mathematical formula, algorithm and case study related to Malicious Activity Classification.\r\nIn all, the technical section is missing. And I would like to reject this paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper lacks novelty of research, its just a comparison of three ML classifiers.

The proposed scheme seams interesting and novel. However, I have following suggestions to improve its overall quality.\r\n1. In the fourth part, for the given dataset, the process of feature engineering implementation and machine learning algorithm selection was not fully described. Besides, the design basis of comparative experiment was not fully explained, and the evaluation indicators mentioned in the process was also not specifically introduced.\r\n2.There are several related works which are similar to the author&#39;s research contents, so it is suggested that the author should make a comparative analysis.\r\n10.3233/IDA-163137;\r\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9116932;\r\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2020.101863;\r\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/spy2.86;\r\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.02.017;  \r\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102177\r\n3.

I have no further comments.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 1\r\n\r\n<b>ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR</b>:\r\nThe Reviewer thanks the authors for their time and efforts in revising the correspondence. After reading the revised correspondence and the authors’ response letter, unfortunately, the Reviewer still has to raise major comments on this work, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. In previous comment 2, the Reviewer suggests the authors to theoretically discuss the complexity of the proposed CNN framework and examine the impacts of system parameters on the complexity. This comment expects the authors to provide an analytical expression to quantify the complexity and explicitly show the impacts of system parameters on the complexity. However, the authors did not do so. The authors use a figure to show the complexity for a specific scenario, which does not show generalized insights into complexity discussion. Thus, the authors’ response to the Reviewer’s previous comment 2 is not satisfying.\r\n\r\n2. In previous comment 3, the Reviewer suggests the authors to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed CNN framework. This comment expects the authors to provide results showing the proposed CNN framework (e.g. in a relatively simplified scenario) matches the performance achieved by some existing schemes (e.g. those designed for this relatively simplified scenario). However, the authors did not do so. The authors use a table to show the so-called accuracy being improved when the number of samples, the number of filters, and the SNR increase. This conclusion is self-obvious, but does not provide the expected insights into the effectiveness of the proposed CNN framework. Also, the accuracy of over 87% for a very large number of samples and filters, as well as the RMSE of 0.109 for a very high SNR of 25dB are not practically important. Also, the authors use a figure to compare the accuracy and computational cost of the proposed framework with existing schemes. It is quite surprising to see that the proposed framework achieves a much higher accuracy with a much lower computational cost. Specifically, what is the cost for gaining such benefits? Without the theoretical characterization of complexity, such evaluation does not show much insight.\r\n\r\n3. The presentation quality of this correspondence is still low. For example, “was designed” in the Abstract needs to be revised as “is designed”. Also, “a advanced CNN architecture” in Section I needs to be revised as “an advanced CNN architecture”. Furthermore, the comma after “can be presented as” above Eq. (5) should be removed.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\n<b>ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR</b>:\r\nI thank the authors for addressing my comments from previous round. However, I still have some concerns--\r\n\r\n1. The general problem is to apply machine learning/deep learning for communications. In the introduction section, I don&#39;t see a clear connection that motivates the current problem statement. It is important to provide the readers some idea on why we need AI for communication system. Adding prominent overview papers in references is a good way to address this.

I regret to inform you that based on the enclosed reviews and my own reading of your manuscript, I am unable to recommend its publication in IEEE Communications Letters.\r\n\r\nYour paper may not be resubmitted for review. The reasons for this are as follows: The contribution of this paper is low and not sufficiently explained nor motivated. The literature has not been adequately reviewed, and important related studies are missing. Simulation and evaluation settings are also not sufficiently clear.\r\nAdditional comments include:\r\n\r\nThe reviewers&#39; comments are found at the end of this email.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting your work to the IEEE Communications Letters.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDr. Miguel Sepulcre\r\nAssociate Editor\r\nIEEE Communications Letters\r\n\r\nReviewer: 1\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe authors present a cache replacement strategy for NDN using recency\r\nand frequency information of data. A simulated environment compares\r\nthe proposed adaptive LRFU algorithm with other, prominent approaches.\r\n\r\n1. The main contributions of this paper are vague. I can trace LRFU\r\nback to a publication of Donghee Lee, et al. from 1996, yet this\r\nreference is never given or mentioned.\r\n\r\n2. The adaptive modification of LRFU in this paper seems to equalize\r\nthe sizes for the internally used heap and linked-list data\r\nstructures. Simulation results suggest that this adaptive method\r\nincreases the cache hit rate (at least for the configured traffic).\r\nAn explanation for why this modification yields improvements is\r\nmissing in this paper.\r\n\r\n3. A measurement or a theoretical approximation or the overhead of\r\ncontinuously balancing both data structures on cache entry and\r\ncache eviction would be interesting.\r\n\r\n4. This paper gives an intro to NDN which I appreciate as a reader.\r\nHowever, it can be shortened drastically to gain some space for\r\nbetter explaining the adaptive LRFU algorithm. This description\r\nfalls a little bit short. The work in [1] seems to be more complete.\r\n\r\n[1] < https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8978218 >\r\n\r\n5. Figure 2 appears to be taken from the NDN paper, but is not\r\naccordingly referenced. Instead of Figure 2, a figure that depicts\r\nall compared cache replacement strategies would be more valuable.\r\n\r\n6. The plot for cache miss is IMO superfluous. The cache hit ratio is\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n7. The document needs a language edit, especially in the first part of\r\nthe document.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe proposed letter addresses an established, well researched subject: Caching policies in the IoT. A significant body of work appeared, in particular in premier conferences sa ACM-ICN, but are not considered here. Large testbed experiments have been performed in the last decade - without reflection in the present manuscript.\r\nThis work proposes a hybrid implementation of LFU and LRU policies, which are then simulated in NS-3. There is no clear explanation on what topology is used and what the content and traffic models are. Hence, simulation results do not mean much to the reader. Correspondingly, the reader is left puzzled with unsubstantiated claims such as &#34;Our scheme is best suited for distributed content in the industrial field.&#34; in the conclusion.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nOverview:\r\n- This paper proposes an adaptive LRFU replacement policy for enabling low latency communication in NDN based IIoT\r\n\r\nReview suggestions:\r\n- The authors state that the size of the heap and linked list in a Content Store is usually fixed, and the main aim of the paper is to adaptively assign different sizes to both. However, there are two main concerns with this manuscript: (1) the main motivation for making the sizes of heap and linked list adaptive is not explained, and (2) the details of how the sizes are adapted are not provided in the manuscript.\r\n\r\n- Other important details that are missing in the manuscript are: how frequently are the sizes adapted, what is the complexity involved when sizes are adapted, and are there any potential limitations of adapting the sizes?\r\n\r\n- Another important aspect to note is that there is a trade-off between the improvement offered by the adaptive LRFU and its deployment complexity. From the evaluation section, it is not clear whether the proposed approach offers significant improvements in comparison to its deployment complexity.\r\n\r\n- It is not clear why the proposed approach is recommended only for Industrial IoT applications and not for other use cases of NDN. There is no discussion regarding this in the manuscript.\r\n\r\n- The choice of simulation parameters listed in Table I is not justified. Content size of 1024 bytes is not common in Industrial IoT. It is not clear what is meant by IIoT Content Variation = 1000 and Content store size: 10 - 100 (is it number of packets, bytes?).\r\n\r\n- The authors mention that there are 15 router nodes in the topology used for simulation. In that case, it is not clear the hit and miss ratio shown in Fig. 6 belongs to which router&#39;s Content Store.\r\n\r\n- Part A in Section III does not add much value to the reader as it covers the basics of NDN.\r\n\r\n- The manuscript has many typos and grammatical errors.

This paper proposed a low computational complexity PAPR reduction technique but it does not explain or show the comparison of computation complexity. It is very strange.\r\n2. The result in Fig.4 is quite rough.\r\n3. In FIg.5, it should be evaluated in non-linear channel.\r\n4. In Fig.4, the proposed technique can reduce the PAPR a lot as compared with conventional PTS and original UMFC. However, it is nothing because the BER of the proposed technique as shown in Fig.5 can not be improved whihc is almost the same as that of original UMFC. There are a lot of processes in the proposed PAPR reduction while the original UMFC has nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #2: This manuscript should be rewritten.

After a preliminary reading of your manuscript and in consultation with Professor Mark Flanagan (Executive Editor), we believe that the IEEE Communications Letters is not the right venue for its publication.\r\n\r\nAfter analysis, we believe that the paper is on the borderline in terms of scope for submission to IEEE Communications Letters. This paper proposes a drone detection system based on a machine learning approach (more specifically, based on a convolutional neural network).

However, PV management may be subject to severe penalties due to the unsteadiness pattern of photovoltaic output power that depends on solar radiation. A high-precision LSTM based neural network model named SIPNet to predict solar irradiance in a short time interval is proposed to overcome this problem. Solar radiation depends on the environmental sensing of meteorological information such as temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and direction, which are different dimensions in measurement. LSTM neural network can concurrently learn the spatiotemporal of multivariate input features via various logistic gates. Moreover, SIPNet can estimate the future solar irradiance given the historical observation of the meteorological information and the radiation data. The SIPNet model is simulated and compared with the actual and predicted data series and evaluated by the mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The empirical results show that the value of MAE, MSE, and RMSE of SIPNet is 0.0413, 0.0033, and 0.057, respectively, which demonstrate the effectiveness of SIPNet and outperforms other existing models.

Using private blockchain technology, the proposed technology overcomes the security vulnerabilities of DDS middleware-based data sharing technology used in trap combat systems, while simultaneously addressing the complexity of the increasing number of nodes in private blockchain technology. Overall, the comparative analysis of existing literature analysis and techniques is well-established and the structure and logic of the paper is good, but several unresolved issues remain as follows, requiring supplementation.\r\n\r\n1. Chapter IV The technology you propose does not clearly describe how the technology differs from the existing DDS or private blockchain technology, requiring supplementation. This requires a more detailed analytical discussion of how each step of the proposed transaction generation process is different from existing techniques and how each part contributes to security vulnerabilities overcoming, real-time, node count limits (3n+1).\r\n2. Configuration of the test environment is too limited to be persuasive about the results. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique, it is necessary to show results in more diverse simulation environments (scenarios).\r\n3. The letters in Figure 9 are too small to read and need to be modified.\r\n\r\nReviewer_R12768\t\r\n1. Further supplementation is needed so that the background, necessity, evaluation method, and performance improvement of the paper can be learned through the yoak text.\r\n\r\n1. References No. 1 and 2 to the introduction are ordinary sentences, so we don&#39;t know which ones are cited. It appears that we should err on the side of the notation of the citation.\r\n\r\n1. In the introduction of the introduction, it seems that the background and current problems, needs, suggestions, performance improvements and effects of the paper should be briefly introduced. Currently, the context and expression sentences are awkward and contain some of the content that needs to be addressed in the main topic, making it less legible.\r\n\r\n1. The context of related research is unnatural and disconnected, making it difficult to understand.\r\nIt seems that correction is needed accordingly.\r\n\r\n1. It appears that the description of the figures and tables cited should be supplemented. If you have unnecessary pictures and tables, I recommend you delete them.\r\n\r\nChapter 3 should be revised so that readers can easily understand the overall flow of content. It seems necessary to revise and supplement it for the purpose of the reader&#39;s understanding, not the author&#39;s technical point of view.\r\n\r\nSection 1.4. seems to suggest suggestions rather than problem analysis. It seems that a practical and specific cause and background analysis of the current problem is needed.\r\n\r\nChapter 3 seems to require systematic composition and supplementation of the contents of the proposal.\r\n\r\n1. Usually, Chapter 3 compares the proposed contents with Chapter 4 performance. The current content of Chapter 3 is...\r\nIt appears to be vaguely separated. Reconfiguration is recommended. It is recommended that you recheck whether the content is required for the argument.\r\n\r\nIn the simulation and performance evaluation section of Chapter 5, the evaluation should be conducted according to the problem analysis. Especially for the purpose of improving reliability rather than time measurement, the degree of reliability improvement should be experimented, measured, and compared.\r\n\r\n1. In the case of an unrecognizable picture, it seems that it needs to be modified or deleted. It&#39;s hard to recognize.\r\n\r\n1.

The goal of \r\nthe paper is to show that convolutional neural networks \r\n(CNNs) outperform long-short term memory networks (LSTMs), \r\nboth in case of mono- and bi-directional versions in terms \r\nof better (i.e., lower) computation time.\r\n\r\nThe paper is generally well written, although there are \r\nseveral sentences that are convoluted and hard to follow.\r\n\r\nThe energy forecasting is an important problem nowadays. \r\nHowever, given that the main objective of the paper is the assessment of the better performance in terms of \r\nthe computation time of the CNNs, the authors fail to \r\nsufficiently motivate the importance of a faster \r\ncomputation in this specific application. Their claim in \r\nthe introduction is that &#34;it is expected that such machine \r\nlearning scheme should also be able to deliver in real time \r\nas possible&#34;. This expectation is true in the general case: \r\ngiven that two algorithms have more or less the same \r\naccuracy, the faster algorithm is better than the slower. \r\nHowever, the authors do not bring enough explanation of \r\nthis requirement in the specific application domain under \r\ninvestigation, i.e., energy forecasting. In particular, \r\nfrom the results it can be seen that the tested CNNs are 3-\r\n4 times faster than LSTMs. But in all the cases the \r\nabsolute time required for the computation is in the range \r\nof 4-15 milliseconds. Is this time scale comparable with \r\nthe one of the process under forecasting? What do the \r\nauthors consider as &#34;real-time&#34;? This is not clear from the \r\ntext. If the forecasting takes place, for example, every 1 \r\nminute or even more, the need to have a total processing \r\ntime of 4 ms instead of 15 ms can be considered irrelevant. \r\nThese aspects are not sufficiently elaborated in the paper.\r\n\r\nThe reference to figure 1 is not clear. When figure 1 is \r\nreferenced in the text, the authors are elaborating on the \r\npossibility to use a CNN for 1D data forecasting, while \r\nfigure 1 represents the architecture of the pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the dataset is not sufficiently described. \r\nThe authors refer to figure 2 and to [11], however, there \r\nis no explanation of the meaning of the values in figure 2.\r\n\r\nIn the description of the experimental test, the \r\nforecasting horizon is not reported. Given the history of \r\nthe time series from time 0 to t, how many time instants in \r\nthe future is subject of forecasting? This is a rather \r\nimportant factor in the evaluation of the forecasting \r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.

Although the authors have claimed 5 contributions in Sec1, none of them seems novel to be included in IEEE TII article. For example, improving CNN does not seem to be enough as a standalone contribution.\r\nThe related work section is verbose and not focused. In other words, what are the criteria the authors used to select these works? What are the pros and cons of each compared to the proposed work? All that need discussion in details.\r\nThe methodology is poor and the mathematical foundation missing a lot of needed elaboration. The model itself seems very superficial. Results are not convincing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\n1. The title of article is very confusing which contains three part, not able to understand.\r\n2. Motivation is missing in the Introduction.\r\n3. Related work is too much lengthy without critical discussion about the difference of this work and previous works. Authors can select a few good related works and show the difference using Table based on important QoS parameters.\r\n4. III. METHODOLOGY is the most important section which has been discussed very superficially, just in a page. Please add more details how it has been done?\r\n5. IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION needs more details if future readers want to implement?\r\n6. Section III and IV are very weak sections which needs more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper aims to combine CNN and LSTM and shape a model that classifies benign and malicious DoH traffic in critical industrial systems and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks.\r\nThe work is not at the level of prestigious venues like IEEE TII and seems not so match to the scope of the SI, which is mainly on security and privacy issues on FL which seems not visible in this paper. Also, The English and structure of the paper is poor and needs to be restructured in several parts (see large and unclear plots, like Fig. 3, which no need to keep several spaces for this!!). Besides, I can see the formulation of the LSTM is rewording from [29] (see section III.1), which seems not a novelty of the paper. Why were these dates selected? how they tuned? 75/25? How it comes? 20% validation of training?? The comparison is not fair, comparing single against hybrid?!! It is obvious the hybrid results after some tuning and cross-correlation would be better. What are the achievements of the paper? All seems hidden and not well explore. Why do we need an abbreviation table as the length of the paper and the content are insurgent enough! The related work is longer than the proposed approach section!! I cannot find any real-time analysis on the SCADA model and how the results are related to them? The only thing is the dataset. How will security work on it? All are the questions that I cannot find the response for them. Thus, the paper needs to fix it and try related at the level venue.\r\n\r\n\r\nAE Comments:\r\nAssociate Editor\r\nComments to the Author:\r\nThank you very much for submitting the paper to IEEE TII SI &#39;Security and Privacy of Federated Learning Solutions for Industrial IoT Applications&#39;. We checked the reviews and the paper. After checking, we realized that out of 3 of the reviewers, TWO of them are unhappy with the paper and issued REJECT and one issued MAJOR considering several technical suggestions. All of the issues are that the work is lacking novelty and clarity of representation. As noted by the reviewers, they are annoying on the integrity and coherency of the paper. In summary, the reviewers&#39; concerns are:\r\n(1) The original paper does not sufficiently care about the structure, and some typos are found that need to be omitted.\r\n(2) The reviewers require serious attention to the used parameters, carefully check the comparisons metrics, well explain their definitions, template and organization.\r\n(3) The paper&#39;s technical merit needs to be carefully revisited and address the changes requested which seem to be detailed on various aspects, Privacy/security and SACADA design-oriented aspects\r\n(4) critics on the security and privacy leakage in results and their questions as integration with the proposed model and architecture.\r\n\r\nAfter considering such issues, the AE team decided to REJECT the work.

Find below some observations regarding it:\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer 1:\r\n\r\nIn this research work is presented a condition monitoring and fault diagnosis strategy based on deep autoencoder and long short-term memory for identifying different fault condition in bearings.\r\n \r\nThe addressed topic is a current topic of high interest to the research community, even more if the use of Deep Learning techniques is applied to face critical problems related to the malfunction of rotating systems.\r\nAlthough the research topic is interesting, the proposed work lacks of novelty and the contribution is not clear. The authors have to clarify what is the solved problems.\r\nThe manuscript has to be written in an impersonal way.\r\nThe introduction has to be reinforced by including the discussion of previous published works related to the addressed topic.\r\nA theoretical section is missing, in most of the research papers is mandatory to include all the theoretical basis to carry out the proposed method.\r\nNormally, Figures and Tables are first mentioned in the text and then includes.\r\nA more detailed description of the proposed method has to be appended.\r\nThe results must be discussed aiming to provide short conclusions.\r\nThe number of included references is not sufficient to support the proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer 2:\r\n\r\nThis paper proposes an Autoencoder-LSTM method for bearing fault detection, which can distinguish vibration anomalies from sensor readings. The model performance is illustrated with a real NASA bearing vibration dataset. Model comparisons are conducted to demonstrate the better model performance over two classical algorithms. I have several major concerns listed as follows:\r\n1. The motivation is not clear to me. The authors introduced how they used an autoencoder-LSTM method to analyze a real dataset, but did not explain why such a method must be used. Besides, there are only 9 reference papers listed. A more comprehensive literature review needs to be conducted.\r\n2. In the methodology level, it seems that the authors proposed a new Autoencoder-LSTM model. However, this model is only mentioned in Section 3.3 as a very short paragraph. More efforts should be put to clarify the model novelty.\r\n3. In Section 2.1, the authors claimed “A total of 445 and 538 datasets were used for preparation and testing”. Why did the authors choose such a split? There are more advanced methods such as cross-validation with random splitting.\r\n4. In Section 4 on result analyses, more descriptions, in-depth analysis and interpretations should be provided.\r\n5. The paper writing is poor and needs a substantial improvement, e.g.,\r\n（1）Line 37, change “gives”to “give”, also carefully check this sentence.\r\n（2）Line 40, add “is” before “called”;\r\n（3）Line 81, change “hhas” to “has”;\r\n (4)   Line 140, change “scores is” to “scores are”.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer 3:\r\n\r\nThe paper developed LSTM for  fault prediction. The paper has several issues, including not enough reference to existing studies on fault detection, no novel methodology, not not enough experimental results and comparison to state-of-the-art. Moreover, why LSTM was used, is there any other study based on LSTM, how the network was optimised are missing. \r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer 4:\r\n\r\nThe authors presented a novel approach using the latent vector from the LSTM algorithm to detect the abnormal bearing behaviors in the temporal domain. Overall, the idea itself is interesting but the current version of the presentation is not suitable for publication for the following reasons:\r\n \r\nFirst, the physical meaning of the dataset is very vague. I have read so many times but failed to understand that is the data measuring for.\r\n \r\nSecond, the figures are very vague. For example, Figure 4 & 5, what are the meanings for the y_axis?\r\n \r\nThird, the quality of Figure 8 & 9 are low. Please do not screen shot the figures from Python but try to plot it by yourself!\r\n \r\nLast, the measurement of fault is unclear at all. Yes, I did saw the threshold was hit under fault status but how about the overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity? Btw, how to obtain the threshold is not provided in the text at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer 5:\r\n\r\n1. You should add a survey on the existing bearing fault detection methods based on a greater number of relatively recent papers in the field. You should mandatory also include in this survey simple, but still effective &#34;classical&#34; techniques frequently cited in the literature and widely used in industry. You can find good surveys on these in the following papers:\r\nImmovilli, et al.: Diagnosis of bearing faults in induction machines by vibration or current signals: a critical comparison.\r\nFrosini, et al.: Induction machine bearing faults detection by means of statistical processing of the stray flux measurement.\r\n2. You should obligatorily emphasize the novelty of the method proposed by you by comparing it with already cited methods.\r\n3. The theoretical background of the method is sufficiently described in the paper, the method can be easily replicated.\r\n4. As you use results (datasets) from the NASA’s Prognostic Data Repository you should mention clearly (providing the URL address) in the reference list the link where these can be accessed. Supplementary, you should prove their permission to use their measured data.\r\n5. You should detail the bearing faults taken into the study and the way these were &#34;modelled&#34; within the testbench.\r\n6. You should also provide the precision of the sensors used in the testbed.\r\n7. In Fig. 2 please correct &#34;thermocoupies&#34; to &#34;thermocouples&#34;.\r\n8. 8: The good accuracy should not be 100% and not 1%?\r\n9.

The authors proposed that solar irradiance prediction is an indispensable area of the photovoltaic power management system. However, PV management may be subject to severe penalties due to the unsteadiness pattern of photovoltaic output power that depends on solar radiation. A high-precision long-short term memory (LSTM) based neural network model named SIPNet to predict solar irradiance in a short time interval is proposed to overcome this problem. LSTM neural network can concurrently learn the spatiotemporal of multivariate input features via various logistic gates. Moreover, SIPNet can estimate the future solar irradiance given the historical observation of the meteorological information and the radiation data. The SIPNet model is simulated and compared with the actual and predicted data series and evaluated by the mean absolute error, mean square error, and root means square error. The empirical results show that the value of mean absolute error, mean square error, and root means the square error of SIPNet is 0.0413, 0.0033, and 0.057, respectively, which demonstrate the effectiveness of SIPNet and outperforms other existing models.\r\n1.

Im assuming you mean RMSE.\r\n- cross-correlation [3] is a bit misleading. It is true that [3] uses cross-correlation, but this is not a method, it is just a preprocessing block used to obtain the cross-correlation matrix between the subarrays data to\r\nconstruct a data matrix with free noise. This matrix is then used as input to a proposed algorithm. So insted of &#39;cross-correlation [3]&#34;, this reviewer suggests replacing it with &#34;cross-correlated-based methods[3]&#34;, since the enumeration\r\nof keypoints preceeding cross-correlation (beamforming, subspace) and after (ML methods) are &#34;methods&#34; not matrices or pre-processors (if that makes sense)\r\n- &#34;Furthermore, the\r\nsimulation results demonstrate that ML-based DOA estimation\r\ntechniques are more efficient than model-driven DFM in terms\r\nof accuracy and computational complexity.&#34; Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re exaggerating ? Even though maximum likelihood is not found in your simulations, I&#39;m pretty sure that it outperforms all CNNs mentioned.\r\n- You compare classification accuracy with MUSIC but you don&#39;t mention computational complexity of MUSIC in Table I. Why ? Is it because MUSIC is way faster ?\r\n- Why a_i(\\theta_i) in equation (3) and not simply a(\\theta_i) ?\r\n- Equation (1) you mean A(\\Theta) and not A(\\theta) as per your definition in the preceeding paragraph \\Theta = [\\theta_1 \\ldots \\theta_P]\r\n- You use x twice (equation (4) and equation (1)), please pick another notation for digital form.\r\n- Can you please explain what you mean by &#34;At this point, the AOA is biased owing to the correlation of\r\nnon-significant components between various NLOS signals&#34;\r\n- If the multipath model in (5) is used in simulations, it is, to the best of my knowledge, impossible that MUSIC works. MUSIC is a subspace method that works when signal components are not coherent (or not totally correlated). This has to be clarified somewhere in simulations.\r\n- Why is ReLU chosen ? It has been mentioned that &#34;is deployed to solve the notorious problem of vanishing gradients with an efficient learning approach for the proposed network&#34;. So, how does the problem of &#34;vanishing gradients&#34; related to AoA estimation ?\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nIn this paper, the authors have proposed a low-complexity and robustly applied CNN for the AOA estimation. There are several major comments that the reviewer is concerned with:\r\n1) A corresponding CRLB should added in Fig 4 as a benchmark.\r\n2) Compared with the MUSIC method, the root-MUSIC is a better choice to represent the traditional algorithms. Because it is a more common method, which is a search-free algorithm.\r\n3) The contribution of the paper should be summarized by fewer points rather than four short items.\r\n4) The authors have lost some crucial and important references related to the DOA estimation and machine learning. [1] is the well-known paper about the machine-learning-based DOA estimation. The DOA estimation for the HAD was investigated in [2]. Therefore, they are very related to this work and should be mentioned in this work.\r\n[1] H. Huang, J. Yang, H. Huang, Y. Song and G.

The paper needs to focus on its contribution and its significance.\r\n- motivation and contribution setup is given in the page 3, but\r\n- connection between the two contributions is not clear, they seem like two disjoint contributions.\r\n- connection between the contributions and the literature review (e.g. Sec.IIA)\r\n- there is not enough space allocated to the first contribution: the implementation of the first contribution is covered in a few paragraphs on page 7, and there is no elaboration of scheduling constraints.\r\n- These contributions should be elaborated on and developed.\r\n\r\n- Simulation results:\r\n- Longer time: This type of system should be tested over longer than 6 hours in order to capture full day behavior (e.g. going to and coming back from work). For example, you could test over 24 hours or over a week.\r\n- More vehicles: Even for a small service area, 10 vehicles seems too small. Is this the size of the actual fleet? If not, can you use a bigger fleet?\r\n- Presentation of results:\r\n- For figures 13-16, 18 using a vehicle index for the x-axis is not super useful, because we don&#39;t care about the individual vehicle performance. For example, you could plot &#39;demand&#39; on the x-axis by considering different scenarios, and then &#39;performance&#39; on the y-axis. You could also include the spread of per-vehicle information in this figure as a box-plot.\r\n- For figures 14 and 15, the y-axis should be autoscaled.\r\n\r\n- Literature survey: The paper provides background on the public transit problem and solutions. It might be worth contextualizing this problem with taxi dispatch problem with a similar, analaous adaptive solutions from the private industry perspective such as [1].\r\n\r\n- Figure quality: Figure 1 and 2 should be remade: technicically, they are deciminating useful (but simplistic) information, and the aesthetics need to be improved to the journal&#39;s standard. Perhaps they can be combined. Captions should be more specific, e.g. Figure 6 caption should say what `N&#39; is.\r\n\r\n- Writing quality: The paper has many typos, e.g:\r\n- page 6 &#34;donated&#34; -> &#34;denoted&#34;\r\n- page 1 &#34;On the other hand, It&#34; -> &#34;On the other hand, it&#34;\r\n- page 2 &#34;Information of Technology (IoT)&#34; -> &#34;Internet of Things (IoT)&#34;\r\n- page 2 &#34;A number of general ITS architectures, that address various challenges and technological developments, have been proposed.&#34; -> &#34;A number of general ITS architectures that address various challenges and technological developments have been proposed.&#34;\r\n- page 3 &#34;which also referred to as the forth&#34; -> &#34;which is also referred to as the fourth&#34;\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] Taxi Dispatch with Real-Time Sensing Data in Metropolitan Areas: A Receding Horizon Control Approach, Miao 2016\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that some reviewers may have attached more comments; please log into https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/t-its to download them.\r\n\r\nEditor&#39;s comments:\r\nEditor\r\nComments to the Author:\r\nIn view of the received comments so far, the recommendation is to reject this submission. The contributions the paper is claiming are not fully proven by the proposed results and experiments. I see criticism regarding the scale of experiments, limited evaluations, indicating the section of results is to cover additional aspects. The information to provide should be sufficient to fully reproduce results, key parameters, how to generate the scenarios or how to access them, etc. The paper is not including key mathematical formulations and background to allow not just the full understanding of the problem but also the full reproducibility of the results. Instead, various diagrams are presented, giving the impression the information and discussion provided are rather superficial. In some sections, the paper is providing information that appears to be way too generic which deviates the attention to the key message of which challenges the paper will really tackle. Key references are missing, making it difficult to assess the contribution in view of the state of the art for this paper. The reference list is fully covering the current developments in this field. Please note that similar problems are already addressed in the literature, so the explicit enumeration of unique characteristics of the paper makes it easier for reviewers and readers of the paper to know the contribution. Finally, the paper needs detailed proofreading.\r\n\r\nIn view of the comments received so far, the recommendation is to reject this paper.\r\n\r\nThis paper was reviewed by two associate editors of IEEE-Tr.

More precisely, time updates to the state and parameter subvectors were accomplished using the third-degree spherical-radial cubature rule. Optimized performance comparisons of the proposed hybrid C-EKF over the existing cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) schemes with-respect-to their probabilistic outages, Yaw error-differences and ergodic capacities were demonstrated in situations of inaccurate PPP caused by GNSS distortions. The opinion of this referee is that this paper is not suitable for publication in its present form. The following issues need to be clarified:\r\n1) This paper has a problem of readability. There are too many abbreviations that reader cannot follow. The authors should remove unnecessary abbreviations so as to enhance the readability of the paper.\r\n2) Compared with the existing Kalman filter models, what are the advantages of the C-EKF model proposed in this paper.

Despite the fact that I don&#39;t see any novelty in this paper. I have the following major issues:\r\n\r\n1) The authors stated that their model: &#34;outperforms other state-of-the-art CNN models.&#34; However, related works statements are very short and without solid comparison with existing work. The authors need to add a Table to show how their work is better than previous works. Also, only accuracy is measured to compare its performance, do you think is it sufficient to show the novelty?\r\n2) Another problem is a design flaw in the machine learning task where the authors do not have a validation set, which could lead to overfitting of the machine learning models. Also, even if the validation set is not available, why not using Drop out or Regularization to avoid overfitting?\r\n3) The authors mentioned that they used Blockchain but how using Blockchain is improving performance, is there any side effect in terms of complexity, latency etc? Also, the authors didn&#39;t provide in-depth details about the Blockchain infrastructure. What type of blockchain is used? Private or Consortium? What type of consensus is employed?\r\n4) What if the unauthorized airborne object frequently encrypts its signals? Can the CNN model still be able to correctly classify it as a threat?\r\n5) The paper needs an English review, as there are some typos.

The authors mentioned the advantages and disadvantages of the 5G or B5G networks, however, the specific direct or indirect impacts on wearable device usage in this era are not clearly addressed. The entire content still separately reviews the wearable and 5G/B5G parts. Therefore, the overall importance of this review manuscript is limited.\r\n\r\n- Fig. 2 and Fig. 8 are fuzzy. Please increase the picture resolution.\r\n\r\n- The authors are encouraged to provide some prospective points. This part can be an individual section.\r\n\r\n- It might be interesting to discuss some potential scenarios which require wearables to perform real-time high throughput (Gbps) communications, enabling B5G to proactively empower wearables.\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1) Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: Moderate\r\n\r\n2) Is the paper technically sound?: This is a review paper.\r\n\r\n3) Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: Moderate\r\n\r\n4) Are the references provided applicable and sufficient?: Moderate\r\n\r\n5) Are there references that are not appropriate for the topic being discussed?: No\r\n\r\n5a) If yes, then please indicate which references should be removed.:\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Reject (updates required before resubmission)\r\n\r\nComments:\r\n1. Analysis  and  discussion  in  Section IV and V are superficial and  need further enhancements. It is not clear what exactly authors want to highlight in Section II and III.\r\n2. Figures quality needs improvement. Text in the Figures are not clear.\r\n3. The  introduction section in general can be improved by highlighting the contributions and novelty of the work.\r\n4. The reference to covid looks forced in as there is no specific link to this in the paper.\r\n5. There are lot of typos, especially space after commas, semicolon. On page 7 the sentence goes out of margins.\r\n6. What do authors mean by this sentence, &#34;existing wearable device designs\r\nneed a technological upgrade to meet the objectives of the B5G network&#34;? Should it not be other way round where B5G KPIs have potential to support wearable.\r\n7. Authors claim&#34;COVID-19 crisis has made these market players to continuously\r\nundertake strategic initiatives such as new product/\r\nservice launch, outsourcing of certain processes and functions,\r\nmutual contracts and agreements, and merger and\r\ncollaborations to sustain market position, maintain global\r\nrelevance, and maximize profits while meeting the demands\r\nof millennial end-users.&#34; How? Give reference.\r\n8. Why do authors think that implantable\r\nwearable device technologies will result in better management\r\nof many chronic diseases like cancer, hypertension,\r\ncardiac arrest, diabetes, etc. More details on this would help the manuscript.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1) Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: It is a review paper.\r\n\r\n2) Is the paper technically sound?: Yes\r\n\r\n3) Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: Partially\r\n\r\n4) Are the references provided applicable and sufficient?: Yes\r\n\r\n5) Are there references that are not appropriate for the topic being discussed?: No\r\n\r\n5a) If yes, then please indicate which references should be removed.:\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact article administrator: Miss Garima Mongia g.mongia@ieee.org", "write_date": "2021-12-07T15:30:52Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.134.97", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 406, "fields": {"subject": "Simeon Okechukwu Ajakwe, Cosmas Ifeanyi Nwakanma, Jae-Min Lee, Dong-Seong Kim, Intuitive and Near-Real Time Model for Smart Card Fraud Detection &#8239;&#34;, ICT Express (Reject)", "content": "Manuscript Number: ICTE-D-21-00546 &#8239;\r\nIntuitive and Near-Real Time Model for Smart Card Fraud Detection &#8239;\r\nProfessor Dong-Seong Kim\r\nICT Express\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Dr. Kim, &#8239; &#8239;\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting your manuscript to ICT Express.

For more visibility fragments and/or configuration parameters as well as a screenshot with logs/results of such modeling would be presented.\r\nAs for the UAV scenario the authors have given some additional details covering the system model and particular physical characteristics. However it&#39;d be nice also to see the exact model and manufacturer of the used/modeled UAV.\r\nAs for the experimental results my initial comment would remain valid still. It&#39;s nice the authors measure several target parameters, but I&#39;d expect to see also any more valuable conclusions about these values, including ones on the applicability for the real cases reasoning these numerical values, anything on the effectiveness, etc.\r\nConcerning UANET vs. MANET some responses clarifying these aspects have been added to the article.\r\nFor the Data Drop Rate a due calculation formula has been added.\r\nNeeded explanations on the abbreviations have been added to the text.\r\nFigure 2 has been removed.\r\nFigure 4 has been improved.\r\nA few misprints has been corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer 2:  Are the methods adequately described? Must be improved.\r\n\r\nReviewer 3: The authors correctly addressed all my comments.\r\n\r\nReviewer 4:\r\n\r\nI am still insisting that the paper just investigates the performance of OLSR protocol under different protocol parameters, varying them in range allowed by the specification. This is not a new protocol (E-OLSR) that authors put as part of their contribution. Based on this observation I would recommend to amend the abstract, contribution, conclusion and title of the paper to show that OLSR performance can be improved for UANET by optimising the parameters.\r\n\r\nThe authors added the description of how their proposed protocol differs from OLSR. I have read the references that they have presented in order to prove that tuning of parameters can be considered as a new protocol. The papers did not convince me: the authors of one of the papers [34] used additional energy-based parameter to calculate willingness, unlike the authors of this manuscript that just decided to put willingness of nodes to maximum without any justification or comparative performance evaluation. Another paper [35] is telling about optimization of OLSR for VANET by tuning the parameters of OLSR from RFC 3626 but they did not call this optimization framework as a new protocol.\r\n\r\nThe paper [14] T. K. Priyambodo et al, ”Performance Optimization of MANET Networks through Routing Protocol Analysis”, Computers, 2021 is a very good example of the paper that uses tuning of the parameters and the authors call it performance optimization.\r\n\r\nI agree that some of the OLSR parameters after optimization can outperform the standard ones defined in the RFC 3626 but this is absolutely not a new protocol.\r\n\r\nYou said correct - In UAVs willingness is crucial, as many nodes do not want to send traffic due to preserving energy &#8211; and in the proposed method you set up it to the highest value without considering energy capacity of the nodes.\r\n\r\nThe contribution of authors should be changed:\r\n\r\n- The optimization of configuration parameters of the OLSR protocol to make it suitable for UANET with renewable energy.\r\n\r\n- proposed OLSR configurations outperform the standard one\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLine 320-327: Read again this paragraph, misprints here. The UAVs altitude is considered to keep constant between 200m and 50m. How the constant can be between 200 and 50m? It is variable then\r\n\r\nThe UAV’s speeds are selected as 40 ms and 224 30 m s, respectively. Respectively to what?\r\n\r\nExtended rate PHY (802.11g) is used as the underlying MAC layer with a data  rate of 24 Mbps and 1 Mbps, respectively. Respectively to what? Two experiments?

The article is described as an essential and exciting research topic, but I have some concerns and suggestions for the authors. I hope my comments will help improve the presented work&#39;s quality.\r\n\r\n1) I would like to suggest adding an overview of the Operator 4.0 concept. This is a huge research area that includes many technologies of how we can improve human workers&#39; safety and productivity in the industries. Also, please make a paragraph about the new industrial revolution as Industry 5.0 depends on human-centric solutions.\r\n\r\n2) The article is about the UWB sensor and its use for moving to monitor. The indoor positioning system or real-time locating system is missing from the introduction. I would like to suggest overviewing this area as a huge research topic, and I believe it is relevant.\r\n\r\n3) Figure 1 and Figure 3 are not referred to and not detailed in the article\r\n\r\n4) Fig 2 - there is a BLE antenna, but you do not mention it. Please detail the main part of the sensor device. Also, please define the units of the measured data (breathing, moving samples)\r\n\r\n5) Section 3 - I would like to suggest changing the title of this section to Dataset and Methodology (or something like this). The dataset is not detailed at all. What was the period? What are the units of the measurements? Do you label this data? Was it a planned experiment or a usual working day? Please consider merging subsections 3.1 and 3.2.\r\n\r\n6) The algorithm&#39;s description is too general. Please define a nomenclature for your problem and define the algorithms based on that (the breathing/moving measurement points, etc.)\r\n\r\n7) x is multiple defined. Please make coherent the equations.\r\n\r\n8) The main results are not precise. Please make a better conclusion where you clarify the new achieved result of your work, and a detailed use case is missing.\r\n\r\n\r\nA minor comment:\r\n- the Occupational Health and Safety defined twice: the second paragraph as OHS and the fourth paragraph as OSH", "write_date": "2022-01-10T17:57:40Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.137.124", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 411, "fields": {"subject": "Ikechi Saviour Igboanusi, Jae-Min Lee, and  Dong-Seong Kim, &#34;AIM: Auto Integrated Mining for PrivateWireless Blockchain Network&#34; (Rejected)", "content": "Dear Prof. Kim:\r\n\r\nI am writing to you in regards to manuscript # Access-2021-41910 entitled &#34;AIM: Auto Integrated Mining for Private Wireless Blockchain Network&#34; which you submitted to IEEE Access.\r\n\r\nIn view of the criticisms of the reviewer(s) found at the bottom of this letter, your manuscript has not been recommended for publication in IEEE Access.

It is assumed that the transaction generator and block miner are the same. If this node is a malicious one and generates fake transactions, how will blockchain security be guaranteed?\r\n\r\n2. The section. B- proposed model is very hard to follow. Summarizing notations in a table can help readers to follow this section. Furthermore, notations should be introduced when referred for the first time. Besides, equations should be written in order of their appearance in the text.\r\n\r\n3. In equation (3), D_{N_1} and D_{N_2} are eliminated, while in equation (4) they are existed.\r\n\r\n4. What is the maximum length of each block? If several nodes generate transactions and mine blocks simultaneously, how does the blockchain overcome the forking?  \r\n\r\n5. Tables (1) and (2) are repetitive. Table (3) shows the time cost of each transaction, not table (2) as noted in the third line of column two on page 5.\r\n\r\n6. If several nodes generate a single transaction and mine their blocks, the energy consumption is much more than when all of these transactions mine in one block. Please study this issue and at least study such a scenario in the simulation results.\r\n\r\n7. The performance of the proposed method is very limited to blockchain networks with considered assumptions, and it is not practical in realistic scenarios.\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1) Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: Yes, it studies the delay and energy consumption of the blockchain mining process, a big challenge of blockchain implementation.\r\n\r\n2) Is the paper technically sound?: Somehow, the proposed method is very limited to impractical assumptions, and it is not appropriate for practical implementations.\r\n\r\n3) Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: No, the proposed method performance should be studied for more realistic scenarios.\r\n\r\n4) Are the references provided applicable and sufficient?: Yes.\r\n\r\n5) Are there references that are not appropriate for the topic being discussed?: No\r\n\r\n5a) If yes, then please indicate which references should be removed.:\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Accept (minor edits)\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nThis paper presents a series of methods to reduce the overall transaction finality time. First, the authors integrate the mining process with the sending of the transaction to reduce overall transaction time. Second, the production of the empty block is reduced, which saves energy, storage space, network bandwidth, and computational complexity. Then, an Auto Integrated Mining (AIM) algorithm is developed, in which the mining tasks are performed only when there is at least one pending transaction in the network. Finally, the experiment shows that the proposed methods can effectively enhance the performance of the private blockchain network. However, there are still some issues that need to be revised.\r\n\r\n1) The introduction lacks logic to express the innovation point of this paper.\r\n2) The authors are suggested to give more descriptions for the proposed AIM algorithm to highlight the novelty and contribution of the proposed work.\r\n3) The authors are suggested adding more simulation results and figures. In addition, the authors are recommended to add the existing solutions compared with the proposed solution.\r\n4) Some results need to be explained. For example, in Fig.4b, why does there exist a big fluctuation in the orange line.\r\n5) In the literature, only 10 articles have been cited. More related works should be included in the introduction.\r\n6) In the results, the authors show that the proposed method can significantly reduce energy consumption. How to verify it in this paper? The relationship between the number of blocks generated by the network and the energy consumption needs to be given in detail.\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1) Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: yes.\r\n\r\n2) Is the paper technically sound?: yes.\r\n\r\n3) Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: yes.\r\n\r\n4) Are the references provided applicable and sufficient?: No\r\n\r\n5) Are there references that are not appropriate for the topic being discussed?: No\r\n\r\n5a) If yes, then please indicate which references should be removed.:\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Reject (do not encourage resubmit)\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nThe paper is poorly written with unclear descriptions and problem identification. The paper should explain clearly the problem and present a more focused survey of related works.\r\n\r\nThe paper seems to be built on inaccurate or incorrect understand of the working of blockchain or more generally distributed ledger technology. The paper needs to be more specific on which distributed ledger or blockchain it has adopted as the basis.\r\n\r\nThe paper claims that it has proposed a new algorithm that will start mining only when there is at least one pending transaction. Would blockchain or any distributed ledger&#39;s consensus algorithm perform verification when there is no transaction?\r\n\r\nThe paper claims that is has proposed a new method that can combine transaction sending and mining, to save time. It is not clear at all what does this means. What are being combined and how they are combined?\r\n\r\nAssumption 4 allows only one miner to complete a consensus building? There is no need of consensus when there is only one miner.\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1) Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: Not clear.\r\n\r\n2) Is the paper technically sound?: Not obvious.\r\n\r\n3) Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: No.\r\n\r\n4) Are the references provided applicable and sufficient?: No.\r\n\r\n5) Are there references that are not appropriate for the topic being discussed?: No\r\n\r\n5a) If yes, then please indicate which references should be removed.:\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact article administrator: Mr. Ankit Srivastava a.srivastava@ieee.org", "write_date": "2022-01-18T15:36:24Z", "update_date": "2022-01-18T15:36:47Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 412, "fields": {"subject": "Muhammad Rasyid Redha Ansori, Simeon Okechukwu Ajakwe, Revin Naufal Alief, Jae Min Lee, and Dong-Seong Kim &#34;DWT-based Audio Watermarking Optimization using Genetic Algorithm&#34;, IEEE Transactions on Multimedia Journal,", "content": "From:\r\n\r\njiebo.luo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n\r\ndskim@kumoh.ac.kr\r\n\r\nCC:\r\n\r\njiebo.luo@gmail.com, jluo@cs.rochester.edu, rasyidred@kumoh.ac.kr, simeonajlove@gmail.com, revinnaufal@kumoh.ac.kr, dskim@kumoh.ac.kr, ljmpaul@kumoh.ac.kr\r\n\r\nSubject:\r\n\r\nImmediate Reject: MM-014026 - IEEE Transactions on Multimedia - &#34;DWT-based Audio Watermarking Optimization using Genetic Algorithm&#34;\r\n\r\nBody:\r\n\r\n19-Jan-2022\r\n\r\nDear Professor Dong-Seong Kim,\r\n\r\nI am writing to you in regards to manuscript # MM-014026 entitled &#34;DWT-based Audio Watermarking Optimization using Genetic Algorithm&#34;, which you submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Multimedia.\r\n\r\nThe submitted manuscript was reviewed by our editorial board to determine whether it meets the standards of this journal in terms of scope, presentation and technical depth.

After reading the manuscript, I do not have enough information to understand how some of the above-mentioned parts were carried out.\r\nI suggest that the article entitled &#34;DRONET: Multi-Tasking Framework for Real-Time Industrial Facility Aerial Surveillance and Safety&#34; needs to be revised in the following aspects:\r\n- The dataset built to test the method is listed as one of the contributions. This is only mentioned, but the reference (DOI) to access this dataset is not provided.\r\n- As this dataset is not available, it is difficult to judge the robustness of the model. Even if you are getting 99.99% results if the 100 images of class X are practically the same and the other 100 images of class Y are also the same, then it would be logical to get such good results. It would be appropriate to be able to access the dataset to put the values obtained in context.\r\n- There is an important statement that is not sufficiently validated: &#34;DRONET is an enhanced offshoot of YOLOv5 model designed to overcome the problem of detection of tiny distant objects under hash weather condition&#34;. The problem is that the scenarios described (Figure 7) do not appear very adverse (there is a typo in the sentence, it says &#34;hash&#34; instead of &#34;harsh&#34;) and simply talks about cloudy environments.\r\n- Another worrying aspect is that when describing the hardware architecture, it is stated that YOLO can achieve rates of 140 fps. It does not seem to have been taken into account that these values may be difficult to obtain on a small board, which is what a drone may have on board. Similar works (a possible reference for this work) such as https://doi.org/10.3390/en13215712, which presents &#34;Remote Management Architecture of UAV Fleets for Maintenance, Surveillance, and Security Tasks in Solar Power Plants&#34; show that it is difficult to obtain these values in flight, around 3-10 fps for equivalent models.\r\n- In reference to the above and given that the authors intend their model to work in &#34;multi-tasking&#34;, this type of equipment would perform even worse.\r\n- The authors&#39; contributions should be described in detail, indicating who has been responsible for each part of the work.

The idea presented in the paper represents a sizeable effort and the paper is well written. \r\nThe following are the suggestions of the reviewer.\r\n1.\tAs the author mentioned, the current model has several limitations.

Through editing is required especially in the Introduction.  Many places space after full stop is missing. Line 50-51 on page 1. Line 34-35 page 2, line 46 on page 2\r\n2. Capitalization needed after full stop on line 51 on page 2\r\n3. Authors say that unobtrusive wearable devices have undergone tremendous transformation in their usage. Then they quote First but there is no second to follow?\r\n4. Define p-health system when first referred.\r\n5. Fig.7 shows KPIs are interwoven. What is the reference or bases for the interconnection of KPIs in Fig.7?\r\n6. What to authors mean by &#34;As seen in Fig. 8, energy efficient B5G network\r\nleverages on deploying hardware solutions with massive\r\nMulti Input Multi Output (MIMO) antennas, millimeter\r\nwave frequency band from ease access and communication,\r\nfull duplex and high network dense data rate for fast data\r\ntransmission and sleep modes for efficient resource usage&#34;? B5G and its advantages are very vaguely written.\r\n7. Authors have simply written repetitively 3-4 times that MIMO, full duplex in B5G would assist in wearables. However, how? Some details needed. Simply using these terms is not enough.\r\n8. &#34;Also, with energy-efficient B5G network, it is guaranteed\r\nthat there will be reduction in the total cost of ownership\r\n[45] which is a critical cost component in determining the\r\noverall cost per unit product of any information technology\r\ndevice [46], including wearables.&#34; This sentence appears randomly. What is the meaning of cost of ownership? How is it critical in determining cost per unit product of any IT device?\r\n9. What do authors want to convey these sentences: page 7 line 28-31, page 7 line 53-55, page, page 9 line 39-44.\r\n10. The response letter to the earlier revision was very vague and it was left to the reviewer to fend the improvements over previous version. Clear representation would be helpful.\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1) Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: Yes\r\n\r\n2) Is the paper technically sound?: Yes\r\n\r\n3) Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: Yes\r\n\r\n4) Are the references provided applicable and sufficient?: Yes\r\n\r\n5) Are there references that are not appropriate for the topic being discussed?: No\r\n\r\n5a) If yes, then please indicate which references should be removed.:\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Reject (do not encourage resubmit)\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nThe paper is relevant and describes a review of the wearable market and tries to align it with the requirements of modern healthcare systems. This is based on the first sentence in the abstract. However, reading further I get confused since the authors are indicating: &#39;&#39;performance of unobtrusive healthcare wearable devices based on identified key performance indices (KPIs) in relation to their response to generation networks transformation.&#39;&#39; as their contribution. What is exactly the meaning of the statement?\r\n\r\nTwo notes here:\r\n1. healthcare wearable devices - fitness bands, smartwatches, and smartphones are not healthcare devices or medical devices. So, what the market offers to consumers is not healthcare by default.\r\n2. KPI == Key performance indicator and not index\r\n\r\nLet me emphasize this is not the first review of its kind and the added value of the content appears in: * Identification of KPIs that should be considered Let me emphasize that the 5G and B5G  link is, I would have to agree with the previous reviewer, arbitrary.  Offcourse wearable devices will switch to 5G eventually and will become truly conencted and ubiquitous. Will 5G have an impact on their accuracy or applicability in healthcare?  Perhaps, however, it seems the apparent issue is that the wearables are not used in clinical practice and 5G does not solve that, since the issue is not only &#39;&#39;performance&#39;&#39;. The authors should consider why wearables or patient gathered health data or even real-world data are used only in trials and not in practice and consider how 5G or B5G could contribute.\r\n\r\nAs for the comments:\r\nR1. The abstract needs to be revised and very clear on what authors want to achieve\r\nR2. This is a review paper, as stated in the abstract and under manuscript type, however, the review methodology is completely missing. I would suggest authors to adapt PRISMA or a similar methodology.\r\nR3. The paper is missing clear goals and research questions, to highlight what the authors are trying to achieve.\r\nR4. As mentioned this is not the first review of its kind thus what is the difference from those already published. And 5G is not the answer, since Honestly, I do not know how many wearables are already working on 5G.\r\nR5.  A single work is used to identify KPIs? Those KPIs are I would assume well defined in the cited work, thus why repeated here?\r\nR6. Subsection titles in section V (SMARTNESS is it intelligence?, SPEED is it bandwidth or throughput or responsiveness?)\r\n\r\nSince the methodology is completely missing I did not go in-depth into the content. The theme however is appealing and interesting. Thus I would recommend the authors to clearly focus and carry out a review with a specific goal in mind and follow one of the standardized methodologies. Based on the abstract I would also recommend a proofreading service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1) Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: It could however a standardized review methodology is not followed\r\n\r\n2) Is the paper technically sound?: standardized review methodology is not followed\r\n\r\n3) Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: /\r\n\r\n4) Are the references provided applicable and sufficient?: /\r\n\r\n5) Are there references that are not appropriate for the topic being discussed?: No\r\n\r\n5a) If yes, then please indicate which references should be removed.:\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Reject (updates required before resubmission)\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nThe authors&#39; own contributions to the body of knowledge are unclear.\r\n\r\nCan they describe who they are targeting? How can this knowledge be used? What is the rationale for this review and is it even needed? I commend their work but wearables and B3G seems to be a forced link. Perhaps it would make sense if they draw up a couple of case studies to show how their review is useful for integrating wearables with B3G systems.\r\n\r\nPlease also double check for double check for typos, formatting in tables, and figures.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1) Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: Somewhat but the contributions are not clear\r\n\r\n2) Is the paper technically sound?: This is a review paper\r\n\r\n3) Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: Yes\r\n\r\n4) Are the references provided applicable and sufficient?: Yes\r\n\r\n5) Are there references that are not appropriate for the topic being discussed?: No\r\n\r\n5a) If yes, then please indicate which references should be removed.:\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact article administrator: Mr. Anupam Rai anupam.rai@ieee.org", "write_date": "2022-03-08T11:20:58Z", "update_date": "2022-03-08T11:21:39Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 416, "fields": {"subject": "Love Allen Chijioke Ahakonye, Cosmas Ifeanyi Nwakanma, Jae-Min Lee, Dong-Seong Kim, &#34;Effective Gaussian Process Regression Kernels Selection for Secured SCADA Network Communication&#34;,  International Conference on Communications (ICC 2022) (R)", "content": "------- Review Reports ------\r\n======= ICC 2022 review 1 =======\r\n\r\n> *** Relevance and timeliness: Rate the importance and timeliness of the topic addressed in the paper within its area of research.\r\nAcceptable ()\r\n\r\n> *** Technical content and scientific rigour: Rate the technical content of the paper (e.g.: completeness of the analysis or simulation study, thoroughness of the treatise, accuracy of the models, etc.), its soundness and scientific rigour.\r\nMarginal work and simple contribution.

The presentation needs significant improvement. The notations and the proposed method are not well introduced. There are also many typos, including inappropriate punctuation symbols, non-unified format.\r\n2. The introduction highlights the energy efficiency issue. However, it is not clear how the proposed method can improve the energy efficiency by balancing the sampling rate and the prediction accuracy.\r\n3. Also, the design goal of the proposed algorithm is not clear. Basically, the presented energy consumption model has no clear connection with the design of the prediction algorithm.\r\n4.

The presentation needs significant improvement. The notations and the proposed method are not well introduced. There are also many typos, including inappropriate punctuation symbols, non-unified format.\r\n2. The introduction highlights the energy efficiency issue. However, it is not clear how the proposed method can improve the energy efficiency by balancing the sampling rate and the prediction accuracy.\r\n3. Also, the design goal of the proposed algorithm is not clear. Basically, the presented energy consumption model has no clear connection with the design of the prediction algorithm.\r\n4. Compared with RL, how the data prediction benefits the control at different time slot?\r\n5. The proposed method does not demonstrate the design logic and contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: If any of the reviews include an additional attached file, it will not be attached to this message.

Through editing is required especially in the Introduction.  Many places space after full stop is missing. Line 50-51 on page 1. Line 34-35 page 2, line 46 on page 2\r\n2. Capitalization needed after full stop on line 51 on page 2\r\n3. Authors say that unobtrusive wearable devices have undergone tremendous transformation in their usage. Then they quote First but there is no second to follow?\r\n4. Define p-health system when first referred.\r\n5. Fig.7 shows KPIs are interwoven. What is the reference or bases for the interconnection of KPIs in Fig.7?\r\n6. What to authors mean by &#34;As seen in Fig. 8, energy efficient B5G network\r\nleverages on deploying hardware solutions with massive\r\nMulti Input Multi Output (MIMO) antennas, millimeter\r\nwave frequency band from ease access and communication,\r\nfull duplex and high network dense data rate for fast data\r\ntransmission and sleep modes for efficient resource usage&#34;? B5G and its advantages are very vaguely written.\r\n7. Authors have simply written repetitively 3-4 times that MIMO, full duplex in B5G would assist in wearables. However, how ? Some details needed. Simply using these terms is not enough.\r\n8. &#34;Also, with energy-efficient B5G network, it is guaranteed\r\nthat there will be reduction in the total cost of ownership\r\n[45] which is a critical cost component in determining the\r\noverall cost per unit product of any information technology\r\ndevice [46], including wearables.&#34; This sentence appears randomly. What is the meaning of cost of ownership? How is it critical in determining cost per unit product of any IT device?\r\n9. What do authors want to convey these sentences: page 7 line 28-31, page 7 line 53-55, page, page 9 line 39-44.\r\n10. The response letter to the earlier revision was very vague and it was left to the reviewer to fend the improvements over previous version. Clear representation would be helpful.\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1) Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: Yes\r\n\r\n2) Is the paper technically sound?: Yes\r\n\r\n3) Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: Yes\r\n\r\n4) Are the references provided applicable and sufficient?: Yes\r\n\r\n5) Are there references that are not appropriate for the topic being discussed?: No\r\n\r\n5a) If yes, then please indicate which references should be removed.:\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Reject (do not encourage resubmit)\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nThe paper is relevant and describes a review of the wearable market and tries to align it with the requirements of modern healthcare systems. This is based on the first sentence in the abstract. However, reading further I get confused since the authors are indicating: &#39;&#39;performance of unobtrusive healthcare wearable devices based on identified key performance indices (KPIs) in relation to their response to generation networks transformation.&#39;&#39; as their contribution. What is exactly the meaning of the statement?\r\n\r\nTwo notes here:\r\n1. healthcare wearable devices - fitness bands, smartwatches, and smartphones are not healthcare devices or medical devices. So what the market offers to consumers is not healthcare by default.\r\n2. KPI == Key performance indicator and not index\r\n\r\nLet me emphasize this is not the first review of its kind and the added value of the content appears in: * Identification of KPIs that should be considered  Let me emphasize that the 5G and B5G  link is, I would have to agree with the previous reviewer, arbitrary.  Offcourse wearable devices will switch to 5G eventually and will become truly conencted and ubiquitous. Will 5G have an impact on their accuracy or applicability in healthcare?  Perhaps, however, it seems the apparent issue is that the wearables are not used in clinical practice and 5G does not solve that, since the issue is not only &#39;&#39;performance&#39;&#39;. The authors should consider why wearables or patient gathered health data or even real-world data are used only in trials and not in practice and consider how 5G or B5G could contribute.\r\n\r\nAs for the comments:\r\nR1. The abstract needs to be revised and very clear on what authors want to achieve\r\nR2. This is a review paper, as stated in the abstract and under manuscript type, however, the review methodology is completely missing. I would suggest authors to adapt PRISMA or a similar methodology.\r\nR3. The paper is missing clear goals and research questions, to highlight what the authors are trying to achieve.\r\nR4. As mentioned this is not the first review of its kind thus what is the difference from those already published. And 5G is not the answer, since Honestly, I do not know how many wearables are already working on 5G.\r\nR5.  A single work is used to identify KPIs? Those KPIs are I would assume well defined in the cited work, thus why repeated here?\r\nR6. Subsection titles in section V (SMARTNESS is it intelligence?, SPEED is it bandwidth or throughput or responsiveness?)\r\n\r\nSince the methodology is completely missing I did not go in-depth into the content. The theme however is appealing and interesting. Thus I would recommend the authors to clearly focus and carry out a review with a specific goal in mind and follow one of the standardized methodologies. Based on the abstract I would also recommend a proofreading service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1) Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: It could however a standardized review methodology is not followed\r\n\r\n2) Is the paper technically sound?: standardized review methodology is not followed\r\n\r\n3) Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: /\r\n\r\n4) Are the references provided applicable and sufficient?: /\r\n\r\n5) Are there references that are not appropriate for the topic being discussed?: No\r\n\r\n5a) If yes, then please indicate which references should be removed.:\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Reject (updates required before resubmission)\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nThe authors&#39; own contributions to the body of knowledge are unclear.\r\n\r\nCan they describe who they are targeting? How can this knowledge be used? What is the rationale for this review and is it even needed? I commend their work but wearables and B3G seems to be a forced link. Perhaps it would make sense if they draw up a couple of case studies to show how their review is useful for integrating wearables with B3G systems.\r\n\r\nPlease also double check for double check for typos, formatting in tables, and figures.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1) Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: Somewhat but the contributions are not clear\r\n\r\n2) Is the paper technically sound?: This is a review paper\r\n\r\n3) Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: Yes\r\n\r\n4) Are the references provided applicable and sufficient?: Yes\r\n\r\n5) Are there references that are not appropriate for the topic being discussed?: No\r\n\r\n5a) If yes, then please indicate which references should be removed.:\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact article administrator: Mr. Anupam Rai anupam.rai@ieee.org", "write_date": "2022-04-11T09:26:41Z", "update_date": "2022-04-11T09:38:01Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 421, "fields": {"subject": "UAV Assisted Deep Learning Scheme for Real-Time Detection  of Tomatoes Diseases", "content": "This manuscript does not present any novel development in the algorithm.

(3) An explanation of how the proposed approach is &#34;time-aware&#34; is missing (note that the term &#34;time-aware&#34; is in the title of the paper).

What about computational complexity.\r\n5. Mathematical Analysis of proposed structure and how it is different with other avilable algorithms?\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe paper proposes a time-aware CNN model for efficient smart grid stability prediction. The topic of the paper is interesting and timely. However, it is a bit disappointing that the concept of power system stability is not clearly understood and addressed in the paper. It seems that the authors have a mixed understanding on different stability issues. From the reviewer’s perspective, the contributions mentioned in the introduction are not quite convincing neither from the aspect of technical innovation nor application value. The study is a simple application of a common CNN-based model in a simple test power system. The results from the case study cannot properly support the conclusions in this paper. Therefore, it is difficult to justify the paper brings a significant contribution. Moreover, the writing of the paper should be significantly improved. Quite a few parts of the paper appear to be deviating from the main focus. Further comments are given in the following.\r\n1. The language of the paper should be further polished. Please avoid putting many nouns together for better readability.\r\n2. The length of abstract should be reduced. There are quite a few irrelevant contents, which seem to be deviating and make it difficult to follow.\r\n3. You mentioned the frequency in the abstract. It is not clear in the paper which stability problems you are trying to tackle. In other words, what is the definition of stability in this paper? Transient stability, small signal stability, frequency stability or voltage stability? Etc. Different stability issues have their unique characteristics. The description of the relevant issue is ambiguous, and the significance of this paper is doubtful. This is the fundamental of the paper. Please carefully discuss and provide sufficient information.\r\n4. The term ‘smart grid stability’ is used in the paper. Can you explain the difference between power system stability and smart grid stability? Is there any difference? If no, why not choose the commonly used term? Or it should be the microgrid stability for a smart factory? What is the concept of smart factory by the way?\r\n5. From the reviewer’s perspective, the claimed contributions in the introduction are just a description/repeat of the work in the paper, which should be restructured. The 1D kernel and Max pooling are two very common technologies in CNN-based networks and have been widely utilized in existing research [r-1], [r-2]. Therefore, the innovation is marginal.\r\n[r-1] X. Li, Z. Yang, P. Guo, and J. Cheng, &#34;An intelligent transient stability assessment framework with continual learning ability,&#34; IEEE T.

The review of existing research does not have an in-depth discussion of research gaps and the description of the research target is puzzling.\r\n7. The paper is titled “Time-Aware”, but the reviewer cannot find any description and explanation of this term in the manuscript.\r\n8. Both SMOTE and PCC are very common technologies in existing research. The reviewer suggests that the introduction of SMOTE and PCC and their results should be reduced.\r\n9. The demonstration of Fig. 2. is unnecessary because Bi-LSTM is irrelevant to the proposed CNN model.\r\n10. Please further explain the construction of the loss function for the proposed model. It is unfair to compare the loss value between the model with different loss functions, or the other metrics under different test systems.\r\n11. According to Table II, the accuracy values of LSTM and Bi-LSTM are very close to those of the proposed CNN (99.94% vs 99.88% vs 99.96%), and the F1-score values of LSTM and Bi-LSTM even are higher than those of the proposed CNN. Hence, the proposed model does not perform obvious advantages compared with the existing methods.\r\n12. The comparison in Table II is unreasonable and doubtful, especially the computational time results. Is the computation time of LSTM [r-3] tested by authors or it is cited from the existing papers? If it is the latter one, this is a wrong citation because only a training time of 37.43 seconds is provided in [1] rather than a computation time of 37.43 ms.\r\n[r-3] J. J. Q. Yu, D. J. Hill, A. Y.

The proposed model is only tested in a very small system with 4 nodes. Even for a factory, the power system can be bigger than that. It is required to verify the applicability in much more complex scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe title is not proper. Smart grid is a goal. The current  power grid maybe cannot be called a smart grid.\r\nHence, the title is suggested to change to Time-Aware CNN for Efficient Power Grid Stability Prediction.\r\nThe test system which is only made up of a central generation node and three consumption nodes is so small for the study of stability problem.

Most of my comments had been addressed sufficiently. The research does show that 5G is a part of the solution let me emphasize that integration of the data into clinical workflows and with clinical data and the interpretation of real-world data is a problem that 5G will not solve. Of course, the lack of a standardized universal way to collect the data from the devices and store them in clinical repositories represents a huge barrier.\r\n\r\nThus, although I can agree that the paper can be published I would strongly recommend mentioning some limitations to the study, one of them not considering the non-technical aspects and implications of the use of real-world data.\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1) Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: YES\r\n\r\n2) Is the paper technically sound?: YES\r\n\r\n3) Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: YES\r\n\r\n4) Are the references provided applicable and sufficient?: YES\r\n\r\n5) Are there references that are not appropriate for the topic being discussed?: No\r\n\r\n5a) If yes, then please indicate which references should be removed.:\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Accept (minor edits)\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nThank you for submitting your revised manuscript.

Did you conduct a literature review? Expert workshop? Please clarify.\r\n- spelling/grammar errors, for example on page 2:\r\n&#34;In this section, the layers and concepts of Metaverse were discussed and summarized in Fig. 3.&#34; ->... are discussed ...\r\n&#34;These includes the theories&#34; -> include\r\n- confusing text elements, for example on page 4:\r\n&#34;[enumerate, 1]label = ()&#34;\r\n- page 5: &#34;...Holograktor (Metaverse on wheels) are proofs of the realization of Metaverse.&#34; ->please add &#34;by WayRay&#34; (otherwise one might think this technology was created by Nissan)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order for this article to be accepted, I would strongly suggest improving the methodology of how you gathered the information (e.g., literature reviews, expert workshops), and enhancing the writing.\r\nOverall, I enjoyed reading this article and look forward to future work in this field!\r\nReviewer: 2\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis article provides an overview of the concepts and characteristics of the metaverse. Three major challenges for DDITS are presented: vehicle fault detection and repair; testing of new technologies; and anti-theft systems. In addition, it highlights potential metaverse solutions that can be applied. The authors summarize two main case studies to demonstrate the utility of Metaverse in DDITS: visible to the invisible and Metaverse on wheels techniques. In addition, the impact, limitations, and unresolved issues of metaverse applications are discussed, with some contributions to the connections and challenges of metaverse and DDITS.\r\nBut during the reading, I also found some limitations that exist\r\n(1) Lack of specific elaboration of some related work, for example, in &#39;&#39; Layers of Metaverse&#39;&#39;, why are they divided into these layers, what is the related survey, and what are the reference sources of some key technologies. There is a need for corresponding literature support. Moreover, do applicable Solutions&#39;&#39; have relevant work to support? If there is a supplement, it will be more convincing.\r\n(3) What is the relationship between the two case studies and the current state of research and challenges summarized earlier?\r\n(4) In the discussion section, I feel that the understanding of the metaverse is not deep and extensive enough. For example, the use of headphones as a way of sound feedback is mentioned in&#34;Hardware Limitations&#34;. In fact, there are a lot of interaction techniques in metaverse and AR/VR, so the author may need to learn some related interaction techniques and the corresponding devices.\r\nSome minor issues:\r\n- There are some seemingly growing errors and writing mistakes in the article, such as missing punctuation, missing spaces, or &#34;[enumerate, 1]label = ()&#34;, etc., which need to be rechecked.\r\nReviewer: 3\r\nComments to the Author\r\nIt was a very interesting topic as a study on metaverse and industrial application of metaverse, which is an important topic in various academic fields and industrial fields. In particular, the metaverse application to DDITS was intriguing.\r\nIt is expected that the value and contribution of this study will become clearer if more comprehensive references and considerations are supplemented.\r\n1) In this study, treat &#34;the Metaverse as a digitally simulated world that exists in parallel with its real-world replica&#34;. Metaverse is treated as a virtual simulation test environment related to ITS.\r\nThe research contributes to the industrial application of metaverse differentiated from the existing digital twin should be clearly presented.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Section 2 (Metaverse in Data-Driven Intelligent Transportation Systems) showed potential applicable Solutions to which Metaverse was applied. This will be an important contribution to this study. However, Applicable Solutions presented in this paper are solutions presented conceptually. The application method of the solution should be presented in more detail so that it can be applied to future research.\r\n3) The authors argued that this study is the first attempt to provide a review of the potential applications of Metaverse in the transportation industry. However, the selection process of the research subject to review and the list of papers subject to review were not explained.\r\nTwo case studies were investigated to prove the usefulness of Metaverse in DDITS.\r\nAs a review of Prospects and Challenges, the contents and references are not comprehensive. This may be because there have not been many studies on the industrial application of metaverse yet. If so, the review study may still be premature.\r\nIf not, it is recommended to supplement the review target more systematically and comprehensively.\r\n4) Two open issues were presented.\r\nIf the open issue is developed more comprehensively and specifically, it is expected that the contribution of this study will become clear.\r\nReviewer: 4\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe Metaverse in Intelligent Transport Systems is a timely and important topic. Authors make useful observations and suggestions. However, the manuscript needs to address several issues to be considered for publication:\r\nThe literature review on virtual worlds should also include notable platforms such as Traveler, Croquet, and ActiveWorlds (Mystakidis, 2022). Another crucial development in this field is the proliferation of Open Simulator, an open-source software platform for stand-alone and networked virtual worlds (Kim & Ke, 2017). Minecraft is also an important and popular 3D virtual world platform (C&#243;zar-Guti&#233;rrez & S&#225;ez-L&#243;pez, 2016) which is very popular in educational settings.\r\nP02 “In 2021 The republic of Korea declared that it was going to build a national augmented reality(AR) and VR platform.” &#8211; Please add a source for this information.\r\nIn the definitions of the Metaverse, please add contemporary proposals based on recent publications e.g. (Kye et al., 2021; Mystakidis, 2022).\r\nP03 The sentence “According to [18], XR fuses the physical and digital worlds to some certain degree while utilizing VR, AR and MR” conveys a vague message. XR is an umbrella term that includes VR, AR, and MR technologies (Tegoan et al., 2021).\r\nP04 &#8211; Fig. 3: The origin of these 7 layers is reference 37 which is a web article. Why did the authors choose the particular framework? What is its validity? There are many other frameworks that are worth consideration, e.g. (Bhatia, 2021).\r\nP04: The definition of the avatar is not accurate. An avatar is much more than an icon. It is the embodied representation of the user (Petrakou, 2010). Avatars can also represent non-player characters (Grivokostopoulou et al., 2020).\r\nP04: I encourage authors to cite scientific publications on digital twins, e.g. (Batty, 2018).\r\nP04: The definition of VR is also somewhat vague: users in VR enter an entirely new, synthetic environment that is completely separated from physical reality (Pellas et al., 2021).\r\nP05: The Vehicle Fault Detection and Repair section miss one vital link with the Metaverse which is at the bleeding edge of manufacturing and industry research: digital twins for damage and catastrophic accidents’ prevention of costly equipment and vehicles (al Faruque et al., 2021).\r\nP06: The suggestion that the Metaverse can be used in Anti-Theft Systems is arbitrary and without visible ground in literature. If no convincing evidence can be presented, I recommend removing this section entirely.\r\nOne suggested topic for exploration is the use of Metaverse technologies for innovations for intelligent safety solutions based on AR technologies, e.g. projecting information in the windshield(Mystakidis et al., 2022; Riegler et al., 2019).\r\nP08: The Discussion section should be revised carefully for inaccurate statements such as the following:\r\n“AR, as we know it now, might be used in the Metaverse to immerse users in an alternate world” (ARis based on the physical environment)\r\n“The Metaverse mimics the real world” (it can also be used to create alternate fictitious worlds)\r\nP08 &#8211; section 4.1.1: Valid points are identified. Beyond addiction, there are other ethical issues related to Metaverse technologies worth mentioning, e.g. see (Christopoulos et al., 2021; Slater et al., 2020).\r\nReferences\r\nal Faruque, M.

The publication requirements in terms of work quality are high, IEM readers expect a more informative work in terms of current trends or product development through innovation and research.\r\nIn my opinion, the paper presented is a conventional Review on a specific topic, whose contribution is limited for the objectives or scope of the journal. I recommend that the work should be sent to other Journals or Transactions, which publish this type of traditional Reviews.\r\nAdditionally, some comments that could improve the review are:\r\n&#8226;       The abstract must be significantly improved in order to show the review contribution in comparison with other similar works (reviews).\r\n&#8226;       In the Introduction section, the paper does not provide a relevant idea regarding the objective of the Survey, it only mentions that it is a review of works on 3 topics, in FDM for plastics printing and SLM for metal printing.\r\n&#8226;       In the last section of the Introduction section the contribution of the survey should be clear.\r\n&#8226;       The information in the Table 1 is not relevant for the scope of the Journals\r\n&#8226;       The paper requires a significant improvement in terms of the works discussion, they are only cited; and the advantages and disadvantages claimed by the authors are not described in detail.\r\n&#8226;       The weak point is the lack of the authors’ own contribution in the form of their own assessment of the importance of individual problems and methods\r\n&#8226;       The review is poor in tables and figures\r\n&#8226;       Improve significantly the Conclusions\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments for Author\r\nI think the survey in the manuscript provides a state-of-the-art overview in the field of automated manufacturing. However, it is strongly recommended to greatly improve English.\r\n1. Acronyms. All acronyms must be defined the first time they appear in both the abstract and the manuscript. For instance, FDM and SLM are not defined in the abstract, whereas AM is not defined in the manuscript.\r\n2. Language. The manuscript is readable in general; however, it is recommended that authors make an extensive English revision. There are some awkward sentences in the manuscript. For instance: “The energy melts the powdered metal materials to form the each layer of the 3D object [1].” Should be instead: “… to form each layer …” Other awkward phrases appear along the text.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments for Author\r\n(There are no comments.

The manuscript has been reviewed by three experts in the field and unfortunately, it has not been recommended for publication in TCAS-II. Please find the detailed comments of the reviewers. In overall, the manuscript is very short and the reported novelty is not sufficient. Besides, there are several technical concerns as described in the comments of the reviewers.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewers&#39; Comments to the Authors:\r\n\r\nReviewer: 1\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nFirstly, the results shown in this draft are lack of credibility due to the SAR ADC is only modelled in the Matlab without any practical circuit simulation and verification. Besides, the author states that the proposed technique solves the speed limit of conventional SAR ADC architecture, however, the results does not support his statement. The writing and the figures are also not the standard format of the TCAS-II. I think this draft doesn&#39;t meet the qualifications of the TCAS-II paper.\r\nMy major concerns are detailed as below\r\n1. The proposed technique will suffers from much difficulty if the implementation is practical circuit level.\r\n2. Section II, it is difficult to transfer the sample voltage to the following stage without loss in the practical implementation. If they are sampling in multi sampling capacitor, the different sampling capacitors suffer from mismatch.\r\n3. Section II, the design complexity of the proposed fast-SAR far exceed the normal SAR ADC. The needed comparator number is N-times (N is the resolution of the SAR ADC) than the normal SAR ADC, that need to correct N comparators’ offset. The different DACs could leads to weight mismatch and reference mismatch. Most of the design concerns are not solved in this draft.  \r\n4. The proposed fast-SAR closely resemble the pipelined ADC, like that a multi-stages pipelined ADC with one bit resolution in the each stage, the inter-stage gain is set 1, and the sampling voltage transfer to the backend stages without loss, the reference align is done through the different reference voltage handle in the different stages. However it does not get the benefit from redundancy to overcome the offset, the reference align of the multi-stages are difficult, and the noise of the backend stages is not relaxed.  \r\n5. Fig. 2 and Fig.3 ought to be revised to have a clear description.\r\n6. More simulation results with circuit design should be added.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThrough the limited description of this article, the reviewer cannot agree with the concept of interleaved architecture. Based on the reviewer&#39;s limited knowledge, this structure cannot be considered feasible in circuit implementation. If it is feasible, please provide silicon results or at least a transistor-level circuit. Otherwise, the reviewer believes that this is not a mature article.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis manuscript does not follow TCAS-II guideline in terms of writing. Additionally, the proposed method can only be applied in the ideal system level simulation. In practice, the analog delay line would consume huge power. Multiple DACs and comparators would lead to mismatch problems, which are the major design bottlenecks for SAR ADCs.

The manuscript has been reviewed by four experts in the field. Although the main proposed idea to speed up the SAR ADC conversion by removing the conventional SAR logic control is interesting, but it needs more analysis, circuit level implementation details and some more clarifications. Please find the detailed comments of the reviewers. The authors are encouraged to re-submit it after providing some technical clarifications, analysis, and detailed circuit level simulations results as a full paper.\r\n\r\nReferee(s)&#39; Comments to Author:\r\n\r\nReviewing: 1\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nTo increase the speed, the authors have removed the SAR register and opened the closed-loop system of a SAR ADC. Instead, some other blocks such as DACs, comparators, and delay blocks have been used to generate the required reference voltages for comparisons. According to Fig. 2, the authors have claimed that the speed of the proposed ADC has increased by a factor of N+1 compared to a conventional one (fs=fck). Although there is no circuit implementation for this work, I believe the idea is interesting and can be re-considered after a revision as a brief report since the manuscript is too short. Addressing the following concerns will increase the quality of this work.\r\n1-      The estimated die area should be compared with the conventional one like power consumption in Table 1.\r\n2-      How your new structure affects INL and DNL performance? Please briefly explain and comment on that.\r\n3-      Regarding Fig. 2, the explanation is not enough to easily understand how a maximum frequency of fs=fck can be applied and why the speed is increased by (N+1)? This item is the important one and should be carefully clarified through the manuscript.\r\n4-      As I searched, some more references have worked on speed, and can be added to this work.\r\n5-      In conventional SAR ADCs, mismatch of capacitances results in inaccuracy. Did your design remove such mismatches?\r\n6-      The complexity of conventional SAR logic can be compared with the complexity of your design.\r\n7-      The simulation results are too simple. More details such as FFT can be added. \r\n\r\nReviewing: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThanks for your suggestion of this new concept of TI SAR ADC. You show the model results (Simulink). But further analysis is needed to prove the robustness of your idea. What is the impact of offset in the series of comparators involved in each step of the serial processing? What are the limitations from the successive DAC? What impact of the total power? One need details about all these points to validate the consistency of your idea and also to compare the benefit of this idea as you point it out in your introduction and in your table 1\r\n\r\nReviewing: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper presents an open-loop serialized SAR ADC. This architecture can have a higher sampling rate than the conventional SAR ADC designs. My opinions are as follows:\r\nFirst, the proposed scheme seems completely similar to the already published loop-unrolled SAR ADC architecture. If there is any difference, the paper should mention it and improvements over state-of-the-art versions.\r\nSecond, the proposed scheme is only implemented in MATLAB and not in actual SPICE. The specific case of residue transfer to the DACs of the following stages is tough to implement in the actual circuit. It either requires an active buffer or a passive transfer, and both methods are challenging. Therefore, the paper fails to deliver a novel circuit and does not show the challenging part of its implementation.\r\n\r\nReviewing: 4\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe manuscript claimed a fast SAR ADC. It seems interesting. My comments are as follows:\r\n(1) For successive different samples,  does each DAC need to be reset?\r\n(2) More discussions need to be addressed, such as requirements for DAC mismatch, the comparator accuracy.\r\n(3) It is not reasonable to assume the power dissipation is linear with the DAC bit.

The authors are required to clarify the concerns raised by the reviewers. For example, the introduction and motivation parts should be improved. The related literature studies could be better discussed and compared.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer(s)&#39; Comments to Author:\r\n\r\nReviewer: 1\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper presents a novel smart auto mining for blockchain network. The overall paper structure and explanation is fine but it has some issues which need to be address before the publication.\r\n1.      The introduction section can be improved as the motivation is not clear.\r\n2.      The related work section lacks recent literature related to this topic. The authors are also suggested to make a comparison between the proposed approach with these existing researches.\r\n3.      Section 3.1 can be removed as it presents general transaction workflow of a public blockchain. The text in Section 3.2 can be moved to the introduction section.\r\n4.      Fig 1 is not clear and difficult for general readers to understand.\r\n5.      Can this approach by applied in the production environment? The authors are suggested to add a feature application section.\r\n6.      The limitation of this approach should be clarified.\r\n7.      The English editing can be improved.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis is an interesting work and adding some new information in the existing research. I like the revised version to some extent, I appreciate their efforts but paper is still needs more quality. My comments for the further improvement are:\r\n1. There is need to reduce the size of abstract, make it concise and effective.\r\n2. Introduction is very long, please reduce and make it focused.\r\n3. Motivation should be improved.\r\n4. Critical analysis of literature is missing?\r\n5. Problem definition need to be added after related work?\r\n6. There is need to give reasons of performance variation in detail?\r\n7. Last section should be &#34;CONCLUSIONS and FUTURE WORK&#34;.

(1-3 sentences)\r\nThis work aims to reduce transaction time by integrating the mining process with the sending of transactions to reduce overall transaction time. This work also decreased the overhead of mining in a private network, by reducing the production of empty blocks in the network which saves energy, storage space, network bandwidth and computational complexity.\r\n\r\nThe authors proposed an Auto Integrated Mining (AIM) algorithm which starts the mining process only when there is at least one pending transaction in the network, and stops mining as soon as the pending transactions are mined. The results show that the AIM algorithm reduced the number of mined blocks in a 12 hour period by producing only 24% of the original number of blocks. The proposed algorithm is also able to reduce the storage used to save chain data by 16%. The experiment shows that the mining latency of AIM varied between 200-650ms when the number of pending transactions was between 1-1,000, and had a latency between 350-1,350ms when there were 1,000-10,000 pending transactions in the private blockchain network.\r\n\r\nStrengths: What are the most important reasons to accept this paper?\r\nThe authors proposed an Auto Integrated Mining (AIM) algorithm which starts the mining process only when there is at least one pending transaction in the network, and stops mining as soon as the pending transactions are mined.

The comparison seems unfair since only random forest underwent hyperparameter tuning, while other algorithms&#39; parameters were default. All benchmarked algorithms should be fine tuned.\r\nThe number of estimators for RF is 40 seems too small. How did the author consider the hyperparameter search space? It should be mentioned clearly in the paper.\r\n- Validation technique was done by simple hold-out, it would be better to use cross validation and the final performance can be obtained by mean.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1) Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?

Four other machine learning (ML) algorithms are studied to evaluate the performance of the proposed Ens. RF algorithm.  Generally speaking, the thesis is logically clear, but there are still some details.  For example, the simulation results of some articles are not highly related to the problem to be solved, which is not convincing and cannot reflect the effectiveness of the method.  When introducing the method, the process is not clear; Format error and other problems, the specific problems are as follows:\r\n1)The second paragraph of I section introduces the security vulnerabilities in the Internet of vehicles, and at the end of the paragraph mentions five security threats in the Internet of vehicles but does not continue to elaborate on the relevance of each security threat to the technical points of this paper, or the consequences of security threats in the context of this paper.\r\n2)The last paragraph of the Ⅱ section only expounds the remaining paragraphs and summarizes them as follows. It should simply mention the core content of the first and second paragraphs or directly introduce all paragraphs of the whole paper, so that the content will not be abrupt, and the structure will be more complete.\r\n3)The abbreviation of ITS in the Ⅲ section is not introduced previously and should be added.\r\n4)In Formula 3, the meaning of v variable is not introduced, and the formula notes are incomplete.  The difference between W and W &#39;in Formula 5 is not introduced, and the notes are incomplete.\r\n5)The data in Table 3 and Table 4 should be supplemented with their respective data result descriptions, and the paper does not mention any information in Table 3 and table 4. The data results are not strongly correlated with this paper, and the conclusions in the data table are not clearly introduced.\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1) Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge? yes\r\n\r\n2) Is the paper technically sound? yes\r\n\r\n3) Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner? yes\r\n\r\n4) Are the references provided applicable and sufficient? yes\r\n\r\n5) Are there references that are not appropriate for the topic being discussed?

It&#39;s an interesting idea for anti-drone systems to quickly identify threats in the air.  However, the author&#39;s description of the model is insufficient, there are some additional comments.\r\n1. The innovativeness of KITYOLO&#39;s model is unclear.\r\n2. The dataset is unconvincing.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\n<b>ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR</b>:\r\nThe authors propose an approach for detection and recognition of drones and birds. The proposed approach is based on YOLOv5 and an additional bottom-up path.\r\nThe related work section includes only three papers about drone detection, which is not sufficient. In literature, there exist several works about deep learning based drone detection. For instance:\r\nDrone-vs-bird detection challenge at ieee avss2019\r\nDeep learning-based strategies for the detection and tracking of drones using several cameras\r\nDrone detection in long-range surveillance videos\r\nDeep cross-domain flying object classification for robust UAV detection\r\n\r\nThe overview of the system design (Fig. 1) is confusing. The input images show crops of drones and birds, which gives the impression that the network is only used for classification. The authors should show instead a figure of the proposed KITYOLO (input image, YOLOv5 +PA-FPN, output).\r\nPage 5: Intersection Of Union -> Intersection Over Union\r\nThe authors should provide links or references for Makesense software and the used drone images from Kaggle.\r\nWhat are the dimensions of the recorded images and the images taken from Kaggle? What is the average object size after scaling the images to 416 x 416 pixels?\r\nIs Fig. 6 correct? In case of Mavic_Enter_Cloudy (True) all predictions are classified as birds, which does not match with the corresponding description in the main text. Do false positives only occur in images with Mavic_Air_sunny? Background FN should be removed? The confusion matrix may give the impression that the approach classifies between six drone classes and the bird class.\r\nWhich confidence score is used to compute the precision and recall in Table III and for the F1-score given in Table IV?\r\nThe so-called efficiency graph given in Fig. 9 only provides the precision and recall values used to compute the F1-scores. Thus, the name efficiency graph is confusing.\r\nPage 7: The gap between the capture of Fig. 8 and the main text is too small.\r\nThe authors state that the differences in F-score between KITYOLO and YOLOv5s and YOLOv5+FPN are significant. However, the number of images in the test set is small. It would be interesting to see how the results are in case of larger and more diverse test sets. For instance, the authors can use images from the Drone-vs-Bird challenge dataset.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\n<b>ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR</b>:\r\nThis paper proposed an aerial detection and recognition method for drones and birds. This idea is good. But the overall content of this paper is unclear.\r\nThe logic of the detection method in the paper is confusing.\r\nAuthors should organize a clear algorithm to show their model.\r\nIn addition, the contributions of this paper are not clear, please reorganize the relevant content.

It is suggested for authors proofread this work again and again, and the presentation of the manuscript should be further improved. For example:\r\n\r\n1. Figure 1 is not very professional. In the left subfigure, due to improper placement of the vehicles, the lines of various colors are in disorder. It is suggested to modify the lines and colors to make them distinguishable when printed in white and black. Also, it is necessary to adjust the direction of all vehicles, maybe just like the orange car on the right.\r\n\r\n2. There are some places where authors misspell the “Federated Learning” as “Federate Learning”. For example, the title, the second column in TABLE I and the title of Section II.B.\r\n\r\n3. There are typos in the constraints of Problem (7). “;” should be “:”.\r\n\r\n4. In Algorithm 1, there is no need to state “Pseudo code of Proposed Approach”, and FL-RA-V2X is enough.\r\n\r\n5. In the paragraph above (15), it should be “Jain’s fairness” instead of “Jain,s fairness”.\r\n\r\n6. In the paragraph below (21). It should be “From (17)~(21)”. It should be “SNR” instead of ”SNR”. The quotes are not in the right direction.\r\n\r\n7. The reference to the formula in this paper does not conform to the specification, e.g., Eq. 22. Please check and correct all references to formulas according to Standard IEEE Transactions templates.\r\n\r\n8. It is suggested for authors to change all fonts in the diagram to the format Times New Roman.\r\n\r\n9. The format of the references needs to be uniform, such as whether the words in the title are uppercase or not. Also, the format of all conference papers is not uniform, such as [24] and [28].\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 1\r\n\r\n<b>ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR</b>:\r\nIn Section II. A, the author formulated the resource allocation problem in this paper, and then gave the details of the Federate Learning method in Section II. B and C. However, this paper does not explain how to use the FL method to solve the optimisation problem in (8) with constraints. The author is suggested to add one section to illustrate this point.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\n<b>ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO THE AUTHOR</b>:\r\nThis manuscript studies the federate learning based resource allocation for V2X communication. I have some doubts:\r\n1. The motivations and contributions of this work are somehow inadequate. It is said that “The main goal of this paper is show that FL technique can be applied to the resource allocation for V2X, thereby improving the overall performance of the vehicle users in the presence of cellular user.” However, the FL technique is already shown can be applied to the resource allocation of wireless networks, referring to [20] and the references included. On the other hand, the advantages of applying of FL technique are not that clear, since the solution to the optimization problem is obtained through several transformations, and the improvement of the overall performance is not quantified. Besides, the optimality of the proposed algorithm is not analyzed theoretically.\r\n2. The problem formulation with the objective of maximizing the throughput for all vehicle users is quite common in V2X communications. Moreover, why it is assumed that “A vehicle Vtv is connected to another vehicle via V2V and to a base station (BS) through V2I, i.e. each vehicle is connected to another vehicle and a BS”. Maybe a vehicle is connected to another vehicle or a BS.\r\n3. In section II.C Federate learning over wireless networks, Algorithm 1 is proposed, which shows the pseudo code for the proposed FL-RA-V2X. I think this is not appropriate, since this subsection focuses on the background of application of FL over wireless networks.\r\n4. In section III, the transformation of eq. (7) lack of theoretical analysis.\r\n5. The descriptions of the proposed approach is incomplete. In page 6, the section III ends with the approximation of throughput. The how does the algorithm be performed?\r\n6. Too much contents in section IV. Maybe some figures or descriptions should be removed.\r\n7. Theoretically, how does the proposed approach improve the fairness of vehicles?\r\n8. Please provide concise explanation on the effects of parameters a1, a2, b1, b2 on network throughput.\r\n9. What do Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 illustrate?\r\n10. Fig. 12 show the computing time comparisons. Then why the proposed FL-RA-V2X possesses the lowest computing time? Please supplement the theoretical analysis.\r\n11. Some figures are too big. The equations quoted in the text should be parenthesized. The organization of the manuscript should be greatly improved.", "write_date": "2022-07-27T12:21:20Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.134.88", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 445, "fields": {"subject": "Deep Q-Learning Based SCMA for URLLC in Industrial Wireless Networks", "content": "Dear Prof. Kim,\r\n\r\nWe have received the reports from our advisors on your manuscript, &#34;Deep Q-Learning Based SCMA for URLLC in Industrial Wireless Networks&#34;, which you submitted to Telecommunication Systems.\r\n\r\nBased on the advice received, I have decided that your manuscript could be reconsidered for publication should you be prepared to incorporate major revisions.

The following comments are suggested.\r\n1) The paper is well written, however needs proofreading.\r\n2) The quality and also the number of references can be improved.\r\n3) A statistical model is suggested for comparison of its results with the simulation results. This allows to be able to duplicate the final outcomes.\r\n4) A visual guide in the beginning of the paper in introduction section helps the readers to understand the approach better and faster.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #2: Authors propose an SCMA scheme based on deep Q learning (Q-SCMA), where the codebooks are adaptively constructed aiming at minimizing the bit error rate (BER), maximizing throughput while guaranteeing Reliability and low latency (URLLC mode).\r\n\r\nIn the current format and content, the manuscript presents several critical issues and concerns that must be carefully addressed before receiving full consideration for publication.\r\n\r\n1. The authors suggest comparing the Q-SCMA with conventional SCMA (C-SCMA) and deep neural network SCMA (D-SCMA). However, they did not define clearly the differences (a clear description of each scheme considered) among these three schemes, especially differences among  D-SCMA and the proposed Q-SCMA.\r\n\r\n2. Contribution bullets at the end of the introductory section must be re-stated. For instance, the second bullet does not sound like a paper contribution. Besides, it is more appropriate to change BER to Reliability. Also, pointing out the system performance comparison in different channel types as a contribution must be justified accordingly.\r\n\r\n3. Channel modeling description must be clarified, especially regarding the Rician channel model: quat is the relation of eq. (4)_ and (5) with the vector h in eq. (3)?\r\n\r\n4. The proposed Q-SCMA scheme appears at the first time in Fig. 2, section 2.1. Hence a clear and complete description of the proposed SCMA scheme pointing out features, advantages, and a complete set of equations governing such scheme must be presented.  In the current format, Fig.2 and correspondent paragraphs offer a vague and introductory overview. Alternatively, the description of the proposed Q-SCMA presented in section 3 must be improved substantially (may be anticipated and moved to section 2). E.g., defining clearly the equations for reward, next state, action, type of loss function adopted, NN hyperparameters considered, etc. The relation among the constituent blocks and expressions must be accordingly explored since there is a lack of discussion regarding the novelty related to the proposed SCMA scheme.\r\n\r\n5.Simulation results are provided and compared in terms of BER, bit error probability, and throughput. What is the difference between BER (bit error rate) and bit error probability? Such nomenclature/denomination generates confusion. It seems more appropriate to present the BER results as reliability R = 1-BER and call such figure-of-merit explicitly Reliability.\r\n\r\n6. There is a problem with the definition of eq. (7). Why the SINR is the denominator of the argument of log(.) in the Shannon equation? Anyway, it is paramount to clearly define how SINR is calculated in such context. Please, offer a complete expression definition for SINR.\r\n\r\n7. Supposedly, BER in Fig. 3 is better explored if the y-axis could be changed/adapted to Reliability R = 1-BER. Besides, why Fig. 4 appears BEFORE (on pag. 6) than Fig.  3 (on page 7)?\r\n\r\n8. In section 3, please provide a complete description for the deployed C-SCMA and D-SCMA (including pseudo-codes for each one and a better and compact description); hence, one can understand their differences.\r\n\r\n9. It seems apparent that the superior performance of the proposed Q-SCMA does not come with lower complexity. Hence, the authors must provide a clear and comparative performance-complexity trade-off analysis comparing the three SCMA schemes.\r\n\r\n10. Provide a clear definition for Bit Error Probability in the numerical results section\r\n\r\n11. Formating issue: argmin in eq. (6) must be re-written.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #3: The authors have to address all following comments:\r\n-       Paper title: We suggest replacing the acronym &#34;SCMA&#34; and &#34;URLLC&#34; with words to make the title more clear and accurate.\r\n-       Keywords: We suggest that the author should replace keywords such as &#34;Deep Q-Learning&#34; and &#34;URLLC&#34; because these keywords are already found in the letter paper title. It is better that they replace them with other keywords to increase the reach of the research.\r\n-       There are many acronyms used before define it such SCMA ... etc.\r\n-       Abstract: The abstract is not written correctly, the problem/purpose is not clear, the sentences are not connected. Furthermore, authors should add their findings at the end of the abstract.\r\n-       Introduction Section: The first paragraph in the introduction is not properly structured. Authors should mention the actual researchers&#39; names rather than the word &#34;authors&#34;. Some of the references added in the introduction need a more nuanced critique. The third and fourth points in the main contributions are unnecessary and we recommend that they be removed.\r\n-       Methodology Section: There is an incorrect subheading merge, why was the methodology merged with the results? For example, the first point &#34;simulation parameters&#34; and the second point &#34;DQL Architecture&#34; are not appropriate in this section.\r\n-       Performance Evaluation Section: This section lacks fairness. The authors do not provide comparisons and discussions with existing research schemes. This section requires improvement.\r\n-       Figures and Tables: All figures and table is drawn high resolution. Some Figures and Table are shown before use in text such as Figures 2, 3, 4, 5 …etc. and Table 1. Figure 4 are shown before Figure 3.\r\n-       List of references: The references should follow accurately the Telecommunication Systems Journal style. For instance, some references do not contain enough information such as [2], [5], [10], [13], [18] [25] and [26].  All journal names should be italic. Some research titles begin with an uppercase letter for each word in the title, only an uppercase letter should be used for the first word. Also, the number of references is insufficient for this study. The names of researchers in the reference list are not follow the Telecommunication Systems Journal style. This paper requires an extensive check of the reference list.\r\n-       English Writing: This paper requires extensive proofreading (typos and grammar). Authors have to carefully check the paper to be free from grammatical and typo mistakes.\r\n-       Paraphrase Text: There are many sentences taken from previous papers (whether previous research of the same authors or that of other authors). Authors must paraphrase all sentences taken from the previous papers. The authors must avoid taking whole sentences from the original papers. They are obligated to paraphrase during the revision of the entire paper.\r\no       &#34;how, in addition to an immediate reward for the dynamic environment, reinforcement learning (RL) takes into consideration the long-term objective.&#34; (page2).\r\no       &#34;two parts: the encoder which learns to compress data from the input layer into a code, and the decoder&#34; (page4).\r\n..\r\n..\r\n..\r\nEtc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #4: The manuscript under review supports ultra reliable low latency communication by proposing deep Q Learning based Sparse code multiple access. Code blocks which are adaptively constructed that minimizes bit error rate, maximize throughput while guaranteeing high reliability. Modeling is performed considering three channels - average white Gaussian noise (AWGN), Rayleigh fading channel and Rician fading channel for industrial wireless network environment. Presented results are discussed in terms of better bit error rate, low error probability as well as high throughput.\r\nIntroduction is well written and previous up to date literature review works are well discussed. However, no work from Telecommunications systems journal is discussed.\r\nFew typos are found throughout the document like in abstract:  &#34;average weighted&#34; which should be &#34;average white&#34;\r\nResults highlight that  Q-SCMA outperforms to C-SCMA and D-SCMA in terms of error probability, latency, throughput for AWGN and  Rayleigh fading channels.  and Rician fading channel which mimic dynamical industrial environment also provides performances for Q-SCMA compare to C-SCMA and D-SCMA. Such results need to be published\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that this journal is a Transformative Journal (TJ).

The reviewer questioned the novelty of this work, especially on the comparison with the SOTA algorithms and immature experiments to test the effectiveness of invasion prevention. In overall, I concur with the third reviewer and have to reject this submission.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer(s)&#39; Comments to Author:\r\n\r\nReviewer: 1\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nthe author proposed a new drone detection model however, with no core innovation.\r\n1. Table 6&#39;s result is not far behind YoloV5-tiny-s, and the improvement of fps and gflops is very limited.\r\n2. Table 8 doesn&#39;t look right. The comparison between the classification network and the detection network of Vgg and resnet is a bit strange.\r\n3. The Fig 1 is unclear.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper presents an interesting work, i.e., an operation approach for detecting, localizing, and neutralizing UAVs under different scenarios. However, I think some of the descriptions and results are questionable. My comments are provided as follows.\r\n\r\n1) The title “Drone Transportation System Security: A TEAS Paradigm for Countering Invasion” aims to investigate the Drone security. As we know, security means that defending the cyberattacks. But this manuscript seems to investigate the object detection rather than proposing security solutions against cyberattacks. So the title may be changed to better reflect the research topic of this study.\r\n2) If the author insist on investigating cyberattack, some comment attacks on drones should be presented and which attack is adopted in this paper is also be clarified.\r\n3) The TEAS seems to be a framework including four parts, i.e., timely, accurate, efficient and situation-aware manner. In fact, the author introduced different methods and models to define each part. So the innovativeness of this paper should be further clarified.\r\n4) There are some formatting and other mistakes. E.g., Tables 3-5.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis is essentially object detection work. It doesn&#39;t have to be drone images or conveyed objects. A different neural network structure does not mean it is novel. Actually, it would be easy to come up with a different neural network but the rate of getting a really good one is low. That&#39;s why Google tried thousands of structures before finding Transformer. The object detector was not compared to the state of the arts. The image data collection could also be largely improved., for example, the &#34;toy drones&#34; would not be the best samples for invasion.\r\nDate Sent:\t22-Aug-2022", "write_date": "2022-08-29T14:02:11Z", "update_date": "2022-10-07T09:19:19Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 448, "fields": {"subject": "Love Allen Chijioke Ahakonye, Cosmas Ifeanyi Nwakanma, Jae-Min Lee, Dong-Seong Kim, &#34;SCADA Intrusion Detection Scheme Exploiting the fusion of Modified Decision Tree and Chi-Square Feature Selection&#34;, Elsevier IoT Journal", "content": "Manuscript Number: IOT-D-22-00330 &#8239; \r\n\r\nSCADA Intrusion Detection Scheme Exploiting the fusion of Modified Decision Tree and Chi-Square Feature Selection\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting your manuscript to Internet of Things.\r\n\r\nI have completed my evaluation of your manuscript.

The work is interesting, and the proposed methodology is adequately explained. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed work. Nevertheless, despite the good work, the following remarks should be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n1. First, the introduction can include some more information about the motivation behind this work. Some cybersecurity incidents from the industry can be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n2. Section 2 can be divided into two separate sections: (a) Related Works and (b) Background. The first section can focus on similar works, highlighting the contributions of this one, while the second section can provide information about ICS/SCADA and intrusion/anomaly detection techniques. The corresponding references should be added.\r\n\r\n3. More similar works can be described. For instance, the authors can describe works focusing on Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems about ICS/SCADA systems. Also, the authors can add complementary information about signature-based detection systems and honeypots focusing on ICS/SCADA systems and smart grids. Finally, the authors can describe some survey papers in this field. Some indicative survey papers are provided below.\r\n\r\n4. The architecture of the proposed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is not described adequately. The authors can include some more information about the technologies and the implementation details used for each module/technique.\r\n\r\n5. The authors can provide a section about the attacks detected by the proposed solution.\r\n\r\n6. The authors can include more information about the experimental results. For instance, the False Positive Rate (FPR) is not investigated. For each ML/DL method, the various evaluation metrics can be added to Table 9.\r\n\r\n7. Finally, the paper should be re-checked entirely about potential works.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n[1] Rakas, Slavica V. Bo&#353;tjan&#269;i&#269;, Mirjana D. Stojanovi&#263;, and Jasna D.

Solutions are overall sound and results overall promising.\r\n\r\nPresentation comes handy and it is easy to read and understand the paper\r\n\r\nRelated work needs more attention so that the reader is better presented with current state-of-the-art and how this paper advances the field\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper proposes a novel fog data prediction and recovery algorithm (FDPR) to predict and recover sensor data in IoT networks. The proposed algorithm uses a deep concatenated multiplayer perceptron (DC-MLP) and aims for fast and accurate sensor data prediction. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method on actual devices.\r\n\r\nThe authors implemented some simple algorithms (as described in Algorithms 1 to 3) and evaluated their implementations against similar approaches in literature. From an engineering perspective, this is good work. From a scientific perspective, I&#39;m not convinced that this work (in its current form) has sufficient contributions to justify a journal publication.\r\n\r\nComments:\r\n1. Please be explicit about the scientific contribution of this work: what does this work solve that previous work has not solved yet?\r\n\r\n2. Are there no advantages to Edge on Table II? Please clarify.\r\n\r\n3. Please describe what Historical Data Input (1), (2) and (3) in Fig. 2 are exactly. The explanation on page 5 (lines 39 to 49) is not very clear.\r\n\r\n4. The accuracies for experimental data prediction for related work in Table III are 0%, 11.2% and 44.53%, whilst the proposed method has an accuracy of 99.86%. What is the cause of such a big difference in accuracy between the proposed method and the related work? This difference seems very high for methods that are somewhat similar/equivalent.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe present manuscript introduces a fog based data prediction and recovery algorithm for use in IoT based applications. The proposed system was evaluated both via simulations and real testbed experimentation. The motivation for the research is noteworthy, however, there are a number of concerns, as follows:\r\n\r\n1.

The authors distinguished 4 different layers in their architectural model, however, they consistently refered to the sensors as the edge devices. This is very confusing. The sensing layer contains the sensors, whereas the edge devices seem to be aggregators. If the edge devices perform sensing, then why the need for these two distinct layer? I believe there is a confusion of terminologies here. It is essential that a consistent description be maintained in this article.\r\n\r\n3. What happens during the sleep state of the edge device? Is this the period responsible for missing data? And if so, how long is the sleep time? And how much data is missed in terms of number of samples? I believe this cannot just be two data points. Thus, this is very important to explain in order to appreciate the recovery power of the proposed algorithm.\r\n\r\n4. It is not clear what the recovery method really is. The section on the FDPR algorithm is too trivial and not descriptive enough. My thought is that the authors have consumed so much space discussing existing methods, with little space left to talk about their own contribution. Presently, it looks too weak and heuristic for me.\r\n\r\n5. It is important to discuss the exact recovery mechanism and show how it is unique from existing methods. The prediction approach was achieved by simply increasing the number of hidden layers, which is well known in the literature and it is therefore not a contribution.\r\n\r\n6. The authors failed to discuss the training time. This must have contributed to the entire latency of their system. Why was this excluded?\r\n\r\n7. The results are poorly discussed. Authors also presented results but failed to clearly explain why their method performed better than the existing ones. In this case, authors need to be aware of why their method performed well and others did not. This was missing and should be included throughout the results section.\r\n\r\nAE Comments:\r\nAssociate Editor\r\nComments to the Author:\r\nAlthough the idea is promising, the reviewers felt the work needs further development.

Is it to show the shortage of work in this field? or to show the methods that the proposed approach is based on? What is it exactly?\r\n6-      Past studies should be reviewed well. However, only the strong parts of the reviewed studies have been emphasized which makes the contribution of the proposed paper unconvincing. The disadvantages of reviewed studies should be highlighted. The new features of the proposed method and the main advantages of the results over others should be clearly described. The author(s) must highlight in 8-10 lines what gaps are observed in existing literature, which has led to the design of the proposed method in this paper.\r\n7-      It is preferred to provide the related works in a tabular form with the specification of researcher name, title, methodologies used, year of publication, limitations, and so on.

More comprehensive evaluations are needed for publication.\r\n11-     The results of the proposed method are not compared against other methods. Why not any recent state-of-the-art? There have been many good works on this topic recently. So, how will we know about the efficacy of the proposed work with respect to recent works?

Unlike the FedAvg where the clients are randomly selected, in this paper the authors propose mechanism ACS which considers the previous performance of the clients, not choosing those clients with an overall low performance.\r\n&#61485;       The related work is well investigated; however, more related work can be added.\r\n&#61485;       Different from FedAvg FL algorithm, the proposed ACS mechanism uses client&#39;s accuracy to differentiate the clients, however the authors fail to mention how the clients are evaluated. \r\n&#61485;       The subsection 3.2 where the ACS mechanism is introduced, should be further expanded so the reader can understand the concept more in detail and seize the relevance of the proposed mechanism since is not very clear and it is difficult to follow.\r\n&#61485;       In section 5, the authors evaluate their proposed system and mention several times that the processing time is increased with FedAvg + ACS as supported by Table 2,3, 4 and conclusions. However, at section 5.5 they contradict the same statement by stating &#34;Based on all of the experiments performed to test the ability of the proposed ACS algorithm, it was discovered that implementing ACS to FedAvg on FL provided higher performance. Not just in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of processing time, which can compete with random client selection.&#34;(Section 5.5 p. 12).\r\nI would recommend the authors to consider the above-mentioned suggestions.\r\n &#8239; &#8239;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore information and support&#8239;\r\n\r\nFAQ: How do I revise my submission in Editorial Manager?\r\n\r\nhttps://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/28463/supporthub/publishing/\r\n\r\nYou will find information relevant for you as an author on Elsevier’s Author Hub: https://www.elsevier.com/authors\r\n\r\nFAQ: How can I reset a forgotten password?\r\nhttps://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/28452/supporthub/publishing/\r\nFor further assistance, please visit our customer service site: https://service.elsevier.com/app/home/supporthub/publishing/\r\nHere you can search for solutions on a range of topics, find answers to frequently asked questions, and learn more about Editorial Manager via interactive tutorials.

Unlike the FedAvg where the clients are randomly selected, in this paper the authors propose mechanism ACS which considers the previous performance of the clients, not choosing those clients with an overall low performance.\r\n&#61485;       The related work is well investigated; however, more related work can be added.\r\n&#61485;       Different from FedAvg FL algorithm, the proposed ACS mechanism uses client&#39;s accuracy to differentiate the clients, however the authors fail to mention how the clients are evaluated. \r\n&#61485;       The subsection 3.2 where the ACS mechanism is introduced, should be further expanded so the reader can understand the concept more in detail and seize the relevance of the proposed mechanism since is not very clear and it is difficult to follow.\r\n&#61485;       In section 5, the authors evaluate their proposed system and mention several times that the processing time is increased with FedAvg + ACS as supported by Table 2,3, 4 and conclusions. However, at section 5.5 they contradict the same statement by stating &#34;Based on all of the experiments performed to test the ability of the proposed ACS algorithm, it was discovered that implementing ACS to FedAvg on FL provided higher performance. Not just in terms of accuracy, but also in terms of processing time, which can compete with random client selection.&#34;(Section 5.5 p. 12).\r\nI would recommend the authors to consider the above-mentioned suggestions.\r\n &#8239; &#8239;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore information and support&#8239;\r\n\r\nFAQ: How do I revise my submission in Editorial Manager?\r\n\r\nhttps://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/28463/supporthub/publishing/\r\n\r\nYou will find information relevant for you as an author on Elsevier’s Author Hub: https://www.elsevier.com/authors\r\n\r\nFAQ: How can I reset a forgotten password?\r\nhttps://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/28452/supporthub/publishing/\r\nFor further assistance, please visit our customer service site: https://service.elsevier.com/app/home/supporthub/publishing/\r\nHere you can search for solutions on a range of topics, find answers to frequently asked questions, and learn more about Editorial Manager via interactive tutorials.

Ranked feature selection approaches are well-known and there are several to choose from. The choice of chi-squared compared to others is not justified, especially considering the RFE appears to perform better in terms of classification accuracy; why does computation time matter for the feature selection method since this is likely done offline like training? Trimming the maximum depth of a decision tree is also well-known, and the computation time of decision trees is known to be very small. It&#39;s not clear what is to be learnt from this paper. A recent paper has looked at similar concepts in (non-SCADA) IDS datasets: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9700654\r\nIf the SCADA aspects have an impact on what works well, then that should be discussed more in this paper. This paper may be better cast as a comparative study rather than suggesting that MDT-CHI is a novel concept, because it is not novel.\r\n\r\nThe experimental setup is not explained properly. How is computation time measured? Is it including both training/testing, and if so, why combine them? At least, they should be separately measured and reported since they are not both equally important in practical deployment. Were all the results obtained on the same platform by the authors, using the same methodology? It is not entirely clear. The training/testing approach needs to be explained. If the authors have re-implemented the prior work, then they should state so, and identify any deviations from performance results reported by prior work, if any.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation results are hard to interpret. The presentation of all classifier metrics in a table form would be easier to read than the presentation using bar graphs. This would also save more space in the paper to allow for more discussion and explanations.\r\n\r\nThe f1-scores appear to be calculated incorrectly. Double check experimental results and calculations.\r\n\r\nSome typos like WSUTL instead of WUSTL and CICDS instead of CICIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe authors discussed an important topic. However, the contribution of this paper is very limited and there is novelty in the proposed model.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis study presents a framework that employs the chi-square method for resource selection and a modified decision tree for intrusion detection in SCADA networks.\r\n\r\nI leave below some comments that can help to improve the quality of the work.\r\nThe article presents the research problem, motivations, and contributions.\r\nThe set of references presented by the authors is interesting. However, few works from 2021 and 2022 are discussed and compared in Section II and Table 1. This may suggest that this research topic has cooled down, which is not the case. I suggest improving this table and the section with more recent work.\r\nFigures 4 and 5 present very small incomprehensible information due to its size.\r\nThe comparisons made in Table IX regarding the cost of time raise some concerns for me about the fairness of this comparison. Did the authors carry out experiments with the techniques [4], [10], [11], [15], [16], and [17] in the same environment with similar situations of computational capabilities?\r\nSection III.C regarding the datasets used in the evaluation was inserted into Section III, which deals with the proposed methodology. This seems to me to be wrong.\r\nSection III is confusing, and it will be important to remodel it. It is necessary to provide a more complete, clear, and precise explanation regarding the proposed framework. It is important to follow a coherent flow in explaining the framework components to facilitate the reader&#39;s understanding.\r\nThe work brings experiments with 4 different datasets, which is a positive point.\r\nSome Figures and Graphs of results were a little small and difficult to visualize, if possible, improve.\r\nWhat are the next steps of the research? If possible, make it clear in conclusion possible improvements that can be made in weak points of the approach and possibilities for future work.", "write_date": "2022-10-12T11:57:10Z", "update_date": "2022-10-12T11:58:02Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 456, "fields": {"subject": "Vivian Ukamaka Ihekoronye, Simeon Okechukwu Ajakwe, Dong-Seong Kim, Jae Min Lee &#34;RF-RSCV: Robust Security Framework Against Intrusions in Internet of Drone Communication Networks&#34; Journal of Communications and Networks", "content": "Dear Dr. Kim:\r\n\r\nManuscript ID JCN22-DIV2-079 entitled &#34;RF-RSCV: Robust Security Framework Against Intrusions in Internet of Drone Communication Networks&#34; which you submitted to the Journal of Communications and Networks, has been reviewed.

It is clear that this paper combines the existing technology to design a PTS scheme, which has a certain degree of innovation. However, it still has some problems to be considered.\r\n1. Overall, the presentation and analysis of the simulation results are vague please consider elaborating more details.\r\n2. In figure 3, a scenario exists as the probability greater than 1, please present a reasonable explanation.\r\n3. Lack of theoretical analysis part\r\n4. There are typos and format errors in the text and it is recommended to read through the whole paper to avoid these problems.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nIn this paper, authors studied a partial transmit sequence (PTS) scheme combined with a whale optimization algorithm (WOA) for universal filtered multi-carrier (UFMC) systems  to tackle the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).  \r\nIt is important to give clear motivation of the work and compare contributions in contrast to the state of the art works. Is whale optimization algorithm (WOA) used for the first time in this paper or studied earlier for such systems? Please describe it with appropriate references.\r\nAnalyze the complexity performance of the proposed algorithm in contrast to the existing algorithms.\r\nIt is very awkward to see the CCDF value is going above 1 i.e., even more than 10 in Fig. 3?\r\nWhy many terms and their full forms are repeated in the paper? For example, see &#34;partial transmit sequence (PTS)&#34; is repeated in the abstract.\r\nWriting of the paper is poor.

It also discusses the related open issues and future direction. However, the paper has a number of issues, as pointed out below.\r\n\r\n1. None of the contributions is unique compared to other surveyed related studies. While Table I provides a comparison of surveyed related studies, some key aspects such as blockchain, feature selection and imbalance datasets are not well discussed in the paper. For example, there is no reference regarding how blockchain is related to SCADA IDS, the explanation is poor in regard to how important feature selection is to the performance of SCADA IDS, and the imbalance dataset issue is not clearly discussed.\r\n\r\n2. It is mentioned in the paper that the other state-of-the-art related work still needs to present performance details on SCADA IDS. Unfortunately, the paper itself does not well demonstrate the performance evaluation either. The performance evaluation is mentioned in Table VI, considering the impact of feature selection on the performance. However, this comparison is not valid as different datasets are used across the compared approaches.\r\n\r\n3.  At the end of Section II, the authors mention four points showing the major differences between this study and other works. However, the first two points are not convincing as they are common in survey research. The third point is not valid, as shown in my second comment above. The last point states that this study tries to build a correlation between several approaches, but it is unclear where is the discussion related to this point throughout the paper.\r\n\r\n4. The “Open Issues” part does not provide any novel issues. The paper mentioned about the dataset and performance metrics but these are not new. These are well-known issues in the AI-based intrusion detection systems.\r\n\r\n5. The “Future Direction” part only discusses the dataset and deep learning which are employed in much research. Instead, more useful directions for SCADA IDS should be provided, e.g., the impact of mobility, quantum computers, next generation networks, KPI for IDS, etc.\r\n\r\n6. There are many presentation related issues:\r\ni) Page 2, second last paragraph: “Section V” is missing.\r\nii) Page 2, third last paragraph: “AI-based IDS” --> “AI-based SCADA IDS”\r\niii) The text font sizes of Figs.3-7 should be increased.\r\niv) There are many acronyms in the paper. It is better to summarize them in a table for readers’ convenience.\r\nv) Page 19, right column, second paragraph: It is stated that “Recent studies indicate a significant rate…”, but there is no citation supporting the claim.\r\nvi) Page 20: The &#34;Conclusion&#34; section is too long.\r\nvii) others: “systemic”, “F1Score”, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\nHow would you rate the award worthiness of the\r\nmanuscript on the scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best)?: 2\r\n\r\nAre you providing a generalist’s or specialist’s review?: 0 (generalist)\r\n\r\n1.

The manuscript is neither well-written nor well-structured. Moreover, from a technical point of view, the manuscript does not offer any new insights on SCADA IDS and contains several errors. It gives the impression of being hastily compiled and written.\r\n1. The manuscript is full of language mistakes. This is obvious by just reading the abstract: &#34;dastardly effects with severe effects&#34;, &#34;security concerns are extensively prevalent and complicated challenges the SCADA system faces.&#34;, &#34;Moreover, presenting the performance of various approaches.&#34;, and so on.\r\n2. Several phrases are vague and need clarification. For instance: &#34;Based on the investigation&#34; --> conducted by whom?, &#34;a more practical approach&#34; --> how is this measured? what exactly the term &#34;practical&#34; means in this particular context?\r\n3. Bad use of terminology: The authors confuse the terms ML, DL, AI, attack, threat, zero-day, etc. Deep learning is just a subfield of machine learning and machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence. For instance, the authors refer to AI-based IDS, while they mean ML-based IDS. The text contains several instances of this situation: &#34;The learning algorithm of the IDS model based on ML or DL.&#34;,  &#34;Furthermore, the application of DL and ML will enhance IDS performance&#34;, and so forth. They say about zero-day threats while they probably mean zero-day vulnerabilities.\r\n4. The contribution of the paper at hand vis-a-vis the related work as given in the introduction (and again in section II) is convoluted.\r\n5. Section II should be split in two sections.\r\n6. Table II should be dropped.\r\n7. Figure 2 does not offer something important to the text.\r\n8. MiM in p.5 should be MitM (see https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/man_in_the_middle_attack). Also, in the same bullet point, reference [39] refers to a blog article. In the era of TLS 1.3, SSLStrip, etc, are anymore obsolete.\r\n9. &#34;SCADA networks become more stable over time, as network\r\napplications do not join or leave regularly.&#34; Do you claim that such networks were unstable in the past? It is well-known that such network components were quite closed. What do you mean by &#34;applications do not join or leave regularly&#34;? join/leave typically used for nodes in dynamic (wireless) networks.\r\n10. Why federated learning, transfer learning, etc. are not mentioned in fig. 4?\r\n11. What the word &#34;SOME&#34; means in Tables IV and V? Based on which criteria these (&#34;some&#34;) works have been selected?\r\n12. Ref. [163] is assumed to refer to the UNSW-NB15 dataset but it cites the AWID one, which however is not even included in the discussion provided in this section (along with AWID3 -- see the AWID dataset website).\r\n13. Section IV is convoluted, while subsection IV.E just mentions the basic metrics used in such studies. This is very well-known information and contributes nothing new to the discussion.\r\n14. Section V also does not contain nothing really new that provides the reader with fresh insights on this already very well investigated subject.\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\nHow would you rate the award worthiness of the\r\nmanuscript on the scale of 1 (worst) to 10 (best)?: 5\r\n\r\nAre you providing a generalist’s or specialist’s review?: 1 (specialist)\r\n\r\n1.

The paper is properly structured, references are appropriate and, in general, the used language is fine and easy to follow. However, there are several major concerns that need to be addressed:\r\n\r\n(1) Blockchain is presented as a technology that must be used in conjunction with the metaverse, but it is not clear why (i.e., it is indicated that &#34;any virtual platform that wants to be widely adopted has to have the unhackbility and immutability of blockchain&#34; or that &#34;the fact remains that blockchain technology and digital currency will have to be a substancial element of the metaverse&#39;s implementation&#34;). There are other available technologies (some of them more efficient than blockchain in certain scenarios), why should not they be used instead of blockchain?\r\n\r\n(2) Blockchain is presented in Section II.B as a repository that allows users to store data across a virtual world. This may be interpreted as if a blockchain is a technology to store data files, which is mostly not the case (blockchains store small amounts of data, like transactions or file hashes, but not data files).\r\n\r\n(3) In Section II.B it is indicated, regarding the proposed solution, that authorities will have access to all the information, which poses privacy concerns and legal problems. How such problems would be prevented?\r\n\r\n(4) It is not clear how the proposed private and consortium blockchains are communicated. How they are supposed to exchange data? What about their protocol compability and data synchronization?\r\n\r\n(5) It is not clear why web searching can be useful in a 3D scenario. The whole idea of having a Metaverse is to change the way we interact with content, providing a realistic 3D experience. Why go back to 2D instead of proposing novel 3D ways for interacting with the content?\r\n\r\n(6) The proposed WIW module is presented as a solution for &#34;every metaverse user&#34;. This seems to be a pretty ambicious statement, which is not justified in the article. The concept may be extrapolated to any available metaverse, but the presented development is very specific (i.e., it is an ad-hoc development for a specific software plataform and hardware setup). What should be needed by the proposed solution to be compatible with the different metaverses so that it can be available for &#34;very mevateverse user&#34;?\r\n\r\n(7) Were VR glasses actually used to test the developed software? In such a case, the model should be indicated in Table I. This is relevant, since the experience differs notably between a PC and VR glasses, specially when performing tasks like traditional web browsing.\r\n\r\n(8) The presented proof of concept seems to be a mere integration of already available modules. As a consequence, it is not clear which is the actual contribution of the proof of concept. Moreover, Section IV.B presents a solution that is not specific for the metaverse, but a general solution, so it is not clear its contribution to the state of the art. Please clarify these concerns.\r\n\r\n(9) It is not clear which entity generates the 16-digit DNA code. Is it a central authority (e.g., a government, a company)? In addition, how is prevented people impersonation? Are there any foreseen security mechanisms to avoid ADN code cloning or spoofing?\r\n\r\n(10) Fig. 1 is not referenced in the paper. It seems that is the one referenced as Fig. 2 in page 2, in the Introduction. Nonetheless, it is not clear wether such a figure contributes to the understanding of the proposed WIW module.\r\n\r\n(11) In general, language is fine, but it should be revised (ideally, by a native speaker), since there is a relevant number of grammatical minor errors. Most of such errors do not affect the understanding of the conveyed ideas, but others can be misleading (for instance, in the Abstract it is indicated that a proof of concept is &#34;being developed&#34;, but in the paper it seems that the proof of concept was already developed).\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\n- The abstract seems to promise contributions on privacy in the metaverse, but the article does not address metaverse privacy (in fact, lack of privacy seems to be at the core of the proposed system, see below). The abstract is also not clear enough and does not give the reader a good enough idea what specifically the contents and contributions of the article are.\r\n\r\n- The article makes several assumptions about blockchain technology that are questionable, or at least phrased much too strongly. For example, the article claims that:\r\n-- it will be inevitable to use blockchain (opinion, not sufficiently well argued or substantiated)\r\n-- blockchain is unhackable (so far, all software implementations have had errors which have often led to security vulnerabilities. Such a broad claim is not helpful and looks out of place in an academic publication)\r\n-- transactions on blockchain are performed instantly (incorrect - transactions on Bitcoin, for example, do not happen instantly)\r\n-- authentication based on smart contracts protects privacy (not clear without further detail why this should be the case)\r\n-- it guarantees security (&#34;security&#34; is much too broad a term to be guaranteed by any single technology)\r\n\r\n- The article seems to propose a kind of digital panopticon, i.e., a system where the &#34;authorities&#34; have unlimited surveillance powers over all users. The proposed model makes it technically impossible to adhere to data protection regulations like the GDPR: because information about users as well as their communications are recorded on the blockchain (where records are immutable!), users have no way to correct or delete their information. In addition, traceability of users and their actions as proposed in the article is not necessarily a desirable feature. From a human rights and human autonomy standpoint, anonymous access to public resources is extremely important, and would be completely eliminated by the proposed model.\r\n\r\n- The article does not make it clear why blockchain is the most appropriate technology for the metaverse. In particular, some use cases mentioned by the authors would be better realized with other technologies. For example, a distributed immutable ledger is not required (nor the appropriate technology) to enable personal data storage. In addition, the use of permissioned blockchains generally indicates that other technologies would be more suitable than blockchain.\r\n\r\n- The proposed model and proof of concept are very simple and described at a very abstract level. As a result, it is hard to see what exactly the novel contributions of this model are, and how they are realized. For example, the integration of a web browser in the metaverse seems trivial. If there were substantial challenges to overcome, the authors did not describe them clearly. In addition, the article mentions connection establishment between meta-humans as a contribution, but the details for this process do not become clear in the article.\r\n\r\nMinor issues:\r\n- The URL in reference [1] is incorrect (missing characters)\r\n- Figure 1 is referenced as Fig. 2 in the text\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nPaper COMMAG-22-00750:  The proposition of web inside web is interesting; and interesting to see the prototype of the concept. The authors have articulated the vision reasonably well. However, there are a few shortcomings: * In the introduction, the reference to 4bn people able to use the metaverse are misleading. First, it does matter little what they could do; rather, it matters what they do do: there are not even 100m people using the metaverse today. Second, there are not enough headset sold to accommodate for 4bn people using the metaverse. * In the introduction, it is not clear if “location” is meant to be the physical location of the person in the headset or the virtual location in the metaverse. It is claimed that the work is the first one but there is work on DNS servers for the metaverse which seems to be a fairly similar concept. * In the background section, there seems to be a mix up between virtual reality and augmented reality. It is not clear which is which: both are fundamentally different in terms of usage and applicability. This should be made clearer. * The section on blockchains is a complete mix up between blockchains and NFTs. These are really basics and the authors seem to rely a lot on blockchain. They should get this technically right and not confuse readers. * In the section on the proposed model, the used architecture / protocols are really confusing. It might be because there is a lot of confusion on public vs permissioned blockchains, on what NFTs are, how smart contracts are being used. * The usage of immutable ledgers to record web access in the metaverse is creepy, to say the least. Even smart contract rules can reveal browsing behaviour which is violating prominent privacy laws, such as GDPR. * The purpose of the prototype is not really clear. The WIW does not cater for the spatial and immersive capabilities of the metaverse. It is a 2D projection into a 3D space &#8211; not very innovative. Overall, the paper seems to be a quickly assembled concept study based on some emerging technologies. It requires more work to be suitable to the readership of the IEEE Communications Magazine. \r\n\r\nReviewer Suggested References, if applicable:\r\nReviewer: 1\r\nSuggested References: N/A\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\nSuggested References: N/A\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\nSuggested References: N/A", "write_date": "2023-02-28T01:34:34Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "202.31.134.88", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 467, "fields": {"subject": "Simeon Okechukwu Ajakwe, Ihunanya U.

However, in my opinion the\r\npaper has some shortcomings in regards to some concerns\r\n\r\n1. The literature studies are not fully explained in this paper. Although few studies has been presented, it do not fully reflect to the motivation of the authors study. In my opinion, the literature studies should have objective of the studies, methodology and results, such that it can become as motivation and objective of this project. Rather than simple comparison and limitation of studies, it is suggested to find the similarities and contrast such that we can have the gap between previous studies and proposed one. In several instances I also suggested to cite more relevant and recent literature in order to give a good impact of this paper.\r\n\r\n2. I found that there has ambiguity relationship between Figure 2 and Figure 3. In Figure 2, the hardware architecture is explained, but in Figure 3, the schematic diagram of pH sensor and microcontroller is slightly confused. Moreover, the authors mentioned that 4 sensors have been used, but I do not see any details on these sensors except pH sensor. I would like to suggest to rewrite Section 3.1 and Section 3.2.\r\n\r\n3. Please add details on data acquisition, in particular , how the data is collected and what is the limitation during the data acquisition prosess.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #3: 1.

The overall manuscript is well organized.\r\n&#8226; Although the topic is important to the body of literature, but I have some concerns about the ‘scientific contributions’ of this manuscript. Authors are suggested to refine it to highlight the novelty of the work.\r\n&#8226; Essentially, the technical discussion in this manuscript and the information is presented without a clear objective/foundation and motivation.  Authors are suggested to add one motivation subsection in the Introduction section.\r\n&#8226; A thorough proofreading/restructuring/grammar/sentence formation and spelling checking of this article is essential.\r\n&#8226; The article reports generic works and old references without any criticism or a clear message to conclude by the readers and add some latest references as shown below:\r\n(i) Fusion of blockchain and artificial intelligence for secure drone networking underlying 5G communications\r\n(ii) A taxonomy of blockchain-enabled softwarization for secure UAV network\r\n&#8226; In my opinion, it is more important to think of the applicability aspect of the technology and the associated enablers.\r\n&#8226; Authors are suggested to include a case study as part of this review work.\r\n&#8226; Authors are suggested to refine the conclusion section and include future scope of the study.\r\n&#8226; The presented scheme is well presented but lack supportive references. In fact, one should expect a reasonable number of references in order to support the claims by literature. The main purpose of the article is to guide the research community and direct their attention to the most urgent/uncovered research areas in the desired field of research.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe major contributions of this paper are a systematic review of security dynamics for smart mobility in the context of the Drone Transportation System. The paper addresses the trustworthiness of data legitimacy, appropriation, and authorization during end-to-end communication between participating nodes in its network. The authors also discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with securing cyber-physical systems in the context of smart mobility. Overall, this paper provides insights into the security concerns that need to be addressed to ensure safe and reliable drone transportation systems for smart mobility.\r\nThe key conclusions of this paper are that securing the Drone Transportation System for smart mobility requires addressing several security challenges, including data legitimacy, appropriation, and authorization during end-to-end communication between participating nodes in its network. The authors also conclude that securing cyber-physical systems in the context of smart mobility requires a holistic approach that considers both technical and non-technical factors. Finally, the authors suggest that future research should focus on developing secure and trustworthy communication protocols for drone transportation systems to ensure safe and reliable smart mobility.\r\nIn general, the review paper is comprehensive and informative. However, the reviewer has the following question and comments that the authors need to address:\r\n1. The article lacks clarity in defining and analyzing DTS. While the Introduction section defines it as a drone-assisted priority freight delivery system, which is DIFFERENT from single UAV applications and drones for smart cities. There is insufficient discussion and analysis of system-level security in later sections. Specifically, the article fails to address how an attack on a connected UAV or infrastructure in the DTS would impact system security.\r\n2. The Introduction section proposes a triad relation between, cybersecurity, intelligence security, and airspace security. However, the later sections don’t strictly follow this taxonomy. Specifically, the research and policy effort on airspace security is barely touched.\r\n3. The article fails to differentiate between research, technique readiness, and deployment. In Section V, the article discusses the evolutionary AI models across all domains, IAS, and DTS, and asserts that this is an analysis of deployment. However, most of these AI models were only tested and evaluated using collected datasets or in simulation environments. Some were tested in close sites, but only a few were actually deployed in the real world, and even fewer led to policy-level changes.\r\n4. Section III addresses the increase of DTS violations over time, but what about the increase in UAV usage and penetration rates? Is the violation rate also increasing in tandem with these trends?\r\n5. The authors attribute the &#34;bell shape&#34; distribution of the number of sighted drone violations over months to a Poisson distribution and provide equation (1) to support their claim. However, the reviewer is not convinced and requests further explanation of the model and analysis.\r\n6. The color and legend of Fig. 2 needs to be refined. It is barely distinguishable now.\r\n7. Section IV of the article primarily discusses the DTI counter-invasive approaches that focus on cognitive attacks and compares solutions using single sensors versus the fusion of multiple sensors. However, the article does not discuss defense against drone dynamics communication and decision-making attacks, nor does it cover research on anomaly detection, which is commonly discussed for cyber security research.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: If any of the reviews include an additional attached file, it will not be attached to this message.

The Conclusion is really much too \r\n  short, and the author will have to describe the research&#39;s impact and insights. The author needs to \r\n  rewrite the entire Conclusion section focusing on the implications and discernment of the \r\n  manuscript.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe internet of drones (IoD) network is growing in demand for civil and military applications, but it is vulnerable to cyber threats on the network layer. Thus, a robust security framework is needed to integrate the IoD network into the airspace and safeguard it from lethal attacks. Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are used to secure the communication links of the IoD network from invaders. This paper proposed to build such an IDS system based on the random forest algorithm using the randomized search cross-validation technique for optimal hyperparameter selection. The proposed model was trained and evaluated on three standard intrusion detection datasets. Evaluation results validated its superiority over other models and state-of-the-art models in its precision and swiftness in detecting attacks with minimal false alarm rate.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side, this paper is well-written and easy to follow. This paper clearly motivates the problems in IoD network IDS in the introduction and related work sections. The system design section presents the RF model and shows the challenges and solutions for optimizing model parameters. The evaluation section systematically evaluated the model and baselines to show the effectiveness of the proposed system.\r\n\r\nAlthough this paper has many strengths, there is still much space to improve this paper.\r\n\r\nFirst, this paper lacks novelty. While the RF model is a well-known traditional ML algorithm, I was expecting some domain-specific challenges and insights in applying such a model to IoD network intrusion detection. Moreover, the parameter search problem is also a well-known problem. The proposed solution is generic to any model and dataset. Based on my knowledge, there are well-packaged implementations of both the RF model and RSCV algorithm in sciki-learn [1][2]. Applying existing models and algorithms to existing problems or datasets doesn’t means a lack of novelty, but the paper doesn’t present any domain-specific challenges in applying them to the problem of this paper.\r\n\r\nSecond, the datasets are not specific to IoD network. While the focused problem of this paper is IoD intrusion detection, the evaluation dataset should be specific to IoD network. However, the three datasets used in this paper don’t satisfy these requirements. For example, the CIC-IDS2017 dataset is collected on network topologies including Modem, Firewall, Switches, Routers, and the presence of a variety of operating systems such as Windows, Ubuntu and Mac OS X. It’s hard to convince readers that IoD devices will use the Windows OS. Therefore, it’s reasonable to believe that all the evaluation results and conclusions drawn from these three datasets won’t apply to IoD network intrusion detection. Moreover, even with these open datasets, the well-trained models should be evaluated in real-world or simulated IoD networks, which can reveal the distribution shift between open datasets and IoD network data.\r\n\r\nThird, using the RF model isn’t a best choice while jointly considering both effectiveness and efficiency. As stated at the end of section II, a good IDS system should have a good tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency. However, the evaluation results shown in section IV seem to show that the DT model is a better choice than the RF model considering both effectiveness and efficiency. For example, TABLE VII presents very close accuracies of DT and RF-RSCV models (e.g., 99.55% and 99.64%). However, the  RF-RSCV model is 45 times slower than the DT model for prediction. Similar observations can be obtained from the results of the other two datasets. Therefore, I would doubt the decision of model selection of this paper.\r\n\r\n## Reference\r\n[1] “sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier”, https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html, accessed on March 7th 2023.\r\n[2] “sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV”, https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html, accessed on March 7th 2023.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe research theme is current and the problem is relevant.

While the methods used in the study may not be innovative, addressing the issue of energy efficiency is important and valuable.  However, the paper needs important and significant improvements in the following aspects:\r\n\r\n1- There are differences between the data used in this study and the nodes used in the reference articles (16, 18, 23) used for performance comparison. As the nodes used are not the same, it is likely that there are differences in the statistical distributions of the data. Therefore, it is recommended to create a table that shows statistical information about the data used, as in article 23 (Table III in 23). Additionally, a table or graph showing Spearman correlation values for the five nodes used should be added.\r\n\r\n2- R-squared metric values according to data sampling rates should be added to the performance comparison table (Table 3).\r\n\r\n3- The computational complexity of the proposed DC_MLP model needs to be calculated and compared with other models.\r\n\r\n4- The article does not clearly state the connection between the used dataset and the proposed model with &#34;industrial&#34; IoT. It is not clear why the authors use the term &#34;industrial IoT&#34;. Therefore, a more precise and understandable explanation should be added.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1.

The many-to-one concepts are added to the deep concatenation based MLP (DC-MLP) algorithm to achieve fast computing time and total energy efficiency. My concerns of the paper are listed below:\r\n1. The enhanced DC-MLP algorithm merge multiple MLP models into one. How would you specify the weight of the MLP models?\r\n2. The algorithm that the authors proposed and compared to are too simple. What specific technique contributes to the better performance? Please provide more technical illustration.\r\n3. The algorithms that the authors compared to are always too naive. Are all the algorithms compared in a fair situation? (Simulated with the same equipment and in the same scenario.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1.

If no, why not?: Yes\r\n\r\n2. Is the coverage of the topic sufficiently comprehensive and balanced?: Treatment somewhat unbalanced, but not seriously so.\r\n\r\n3. How would you describe the technical depth of the paper?: Suitable for the non-specialist\r\n\r\n4. How would you rate the technical novelty of the paper?: Somewhat novel\r\n\r\n1. How would you rate the overall organization of the paper?: Could be improved\r\n\r\n2. Are the title and abstract satisfactory?: Yes\r\n\r\ntitle and abstract explanation:\r\n\r\n3.

While the methods used in the study may not be innovative, addressing the issue of energy efficiency is important and valuable.  However, the paper needs important and significant improvements in the following aspects:\r\n\r\n1- There are differences between the data used in this study and the nodes used in the reference articles (16, 18, 23) used for performance comparison. As the nodes used are not the same, it is likely that there are differences in the statistical distributions of the data. Therefore, it is recommended to create a table that shows statistical information about the data used, as in article 23 (Table III in 23). Additionally, a table or graph showing Spearman correlation values for the five nodes used should be added.\r\n\r\n2- R-squared metric values according to data sampling rates should be added to the performance comparison table (Table 3).\r\n\r\n3- The computational complexity of the proposed DC_MLP model needs to be calculated and compared with other models.\r\n\r\n4- The article does not clearly state the connection between the used dataset and the proposed model with &#34;industrial&#34; IoT. It is not clear why the authors use the term &#34;industrial IoT&#34;. Therefore, a more precise and understandable explanation should be added.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1. Is the topic appropriate for publication in these transactions?: Yes\r\n\r\n2. Is the topic important to colleagues working in the field?: Yes\r\n\r\n1. Is the paper technically sound? If no, why not?: Yes\r\n\r\n2. Is the coverage of the topic sufficiently comprehensive and balanced?: Yes\r\n\r\n3. How would you describe the technical depth of the paper?: Appropriate for the generally knowledgeable individual Working in the Field or a Related Field\r\n\r\n4. How would you rate the technical novelty of the paper?: Somewhat novel\r\n\r\n1. How would you rate the overall organization of the paper?: Could be improved\r\n\r\n2. Are the title and abstract satisfactory?: No (explain)\r\n\r\ntitle and abstract explanation: I have reservations about evaluating the article within the scope of &#34;Industrial&#34; IoT.\r\n\r\n3. Is the length of the paper appropriate? If not, recommend how the length of the paper should be amended, including a possible target length for the final manuscript.: Yes\r\n\r\nlength of the paper recommendation:\r\n\r\n4.

My independent assessment of the manuscript echoes the reviewer&#39;s concerns, particularly relating to security concepts and technical contributions. The manuscript also needs significant proofreading.\r\n\r\n&#8226; Reviewer Comments, if any, are listed below:\r\n\r\nReviewer: 1\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper describes the implementation of a system for protecting blockchain private keys using a fingerprint sensor in conjunction with a mobile phone. The private key is released to the phone when a correct biometric, in this case a fingerprint, is applied to the sensor which is connected to and controlled by an Arduino Nano 33 IoT node device. The private key is the secret part of the public/private key combination used to uniquely identify the user for activities on the associated blockchain.\r\n\r\nSince the blockchain may be associated with a crypto currency, the need to protect the private key is of paramount importance. To this end various mildly crazy proposals have been made in the past, and this history is outlined here to contextualize the use-case for the device described here.\r\n\r\nSignificant typos often make it difficult to follow the text. For example “Cryptosteel is another option to store them and can hold up to extended characters”. How many characters? “The last step is while distributing key shares RSA creates an end-to-end.. ”. RSA is not defined before this mention. A major problem are the multiple references to 4-bit and 8-bit passwords, where what is intended (I assume and hope) is 4 decimal digit and 8 decimal digit passwords.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the device itself appears to be hopelessly insecure. Indeed the authors do not seem to have a grasp of security basics. The fact that the private key is actually displayed on the mobile phone screen, is really quite staggering. There is no reason to display it for prying eyes to see. The private key displayed in figure 7 is a puzzling 172-bits in length. I am unaware of any standard public key algorithm which has a private key of that length.\r\n\r\nAs to the device itself it is stated that the “private key is encrypted and stored in the EEPROM of the Arduino Nano 33 IoT”. Now a glance at the Nano datasheet indicates that in fact this device has no EEPROM. As to the encryption, what key is used? If its an 8-decimal digit password, then even that is hopelessly insecure. Now the Nano device does have a dedicated ECCX08 crypto chip which actually does support public key cryptography, AES encryption and secure memory. But inexplicably it is not mentioned here, and so we must assume that it is not used.\r\n\r\nSo from the description all an attacker needs to do is steal the device, break off the fingerprint sensor and read out the contents of the memory. The “encrypted” private key can be extracted and decrypted by trying all possible passwords until the discovered private key matches the public key.\r\n\r\nIn the diagrams there is mentioned a “2nd input password” and a “3rd input password”. But these are not explained. The software is unfortunately not made available for scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome typos\r\n\r\n“perivate” → “private”\r\n“there is non” → “there is none”\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: If any of the reviews include an additional attached file, it will not be attached to this message.

Please see the Abstract for &#34;DT&#34; and Introduction for &#34;WQMS&#34;.\r\n\r\nThere is a mismatch between the claims in the text and the cited references. Kindly review the reference list and ensure that each reference cited supports the argument made in the text.\r\n- On page 2, paragraph 2, The authors say: &#34;Some of these WQMS methods widely used across different countries include the CCME method in Canada, the pollution index method and storet method in the USA, and the IKA method, which is adopted in different parts of Canada and Asia [4].&#34; However, the cited reference 4 does not support the argument made by the authors.\r\n- On page 2, paragraph 2, The authors say: &#34;Most WQMS designs are IoT-based and rely on probing sensors&#39; value in determining and predicting water quality status, which is insufficient and inappropriate due to the errors in the anomalous data produced by these sensors when reading data. Anomalous sensor data are data associated with a sensor reading that is different from the previous reading and not within the range of the sensor&#39;s reading capacity [6].&#34; However, the cited reference 6 does not support the argument made by the authors.\r\n- On page 2, in the section &#34;Overview of WQMS and Related Works&#34;, the authors say: &#34;It is challenging to monitor the water quality in real-time due to the varying amounts of xenobiotics that are released into water bodies by home, commercial, and industrial operations [7, 8]&#34;. However, the cited references 7 and 8 do not support the claims made by the authors.\r\n- On page 2, in the section &#34;Overview of WQMS and Related Works&#34;, the authors say: &#34;According to the EPA, water quality monitoring is defined as the sampling of water components as well as conditions such as added toxins (metals, pesticides, oils, etc) and natural elements in the water introduced by human activities like bacteria, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, etc [4].&#34; However, the cited reference 4 does not support the argument made by the authors.\r\n\r\nThe motivation of the authors to solve the issue of anomalous data produced by IoT sensors is not supported very well with references to past works. The provided references do not contain the arguments made by the authors. The authors need to improve the literature review in terms of accuracy and relevance.\r\n\r\nPage 3 Paragraph 2 last sentence has repetition and is grammatically incorrect, where the authors say: &#34;By putting sensors on the water, collaborating to gather data from the sensors, and then storing the data in an online database utilizing edge networks, real-time monitoring of the water quality will be made possible. real-time monitoring of the water quality will be made possible.&#34;\r\n\r\nPlease check the grammar error where a verb is missing on Page 4, paragraph 2: &#34;Furthermore, authors [19] a comprehensible IoT based WQMS with increased parameters for determining the water quality.&#34;\r\n\r\nIn section 3.1, the authors claim &#34;The TDS sensor determines the oxygen concentration of the water.&#34; A TDS sensor for Arduino usually indicates the total dissolved solids like salts, minerals, and metals, in a solution. If Dissolved Oxygen is calculated using TDS, it should be mentioned along with the correlation.\r\n\r\nThere are five sensors used in the system according to Figure 1 and text in section 3.1. However, Figure 2 shows circuit diagrams of only three sensors. The circuit diagrams of TU, and NTU are missing from Figure 2. If the same circuits are used, it should be explained. Otherwise, the authors should add circuit diagrams of the missing sensors.\r\n\r\nSections 3.1.1, 3.1.3, and 3.1.5: Unnecessary details about the pin configurations of Arduino with sensors and power ports should be avoided to focus on the high-level details.\r\nThe issue with including pin configurations of sensors on the Arduino board is that this information is typically basic and readily available knowledge. Including such details can make the paper unnecessarily lengthy and may distract the reader from the actual research findings. The authors should include only relevant information.\r\n\r\nSection 3.1.2: NTU is a unit of water&#39;s turbidity, with its full form being the &#34;Nephelometric Turbidity Unit&#34;. The authors need to explain how this is used as a unit of water conductivity.\r\n\r\nThe tense of speech should be consistent. On page 7, paragraph 2, the tense instantly changes from present to past: &#34;The cloud-based database module stores the multivariate sensor features from multiple edge devices as highlighted in Table 2. To enable unstructured and structured data types, aggregation, fusion, and meta-data cognitive operations, it was designed using NoSQL.&#34;\r\n\r\nThe details on the training of models are insufficient. The authors should mention any hyperparameters used for training each of the classification models, to make the reported results easily reproducible for the readers.\r\n\r\nAuthors should include some reasoning about why some models perform better than others on their dataset.\r\n\r\nMore details about the split of training and test set should be provided. This is important as the authors claim to achieve 100% precision, an MSE of 0, RMSE of 0, and MAE of 0.\r\n\r\nDespite a comment from Reviewer 1 about adding more details on data acquisition. I see that the authors have not added details about the environment, setting, source of water, and other details about their data acquisition process. It needs to be explained whether the system was taken to a water body, or water was collected from some water body.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #5: There have been many revisions that have been described by the authors. The contributions made through this article are also quite valuable for further research work, ie:\r\n1. To incorporate AI algorithms into Water Quality Monitoring Systems (WQMS) to improve its computational and decision-making capacity for factual and precision-based prediction amidst large volumes of data with multidimensional characterizations from multiple sensors and connected edge devices.\r\n2. To address the fundamental shortcomings of existing legacy IoT-based WQMS designs using the AI learning paradigm, connected intelligence (CI), and connected innovation intelligence (CII) to create value and improve the reliability of the system&#39;s decision-making capacity.\r\n3. To propose a novel approach that blends artificial intelligence and edge computing capabilities to provide instant monitoring and prediction of a given sample of water based on given parameter thresholds as stipulated by the World Health Organization.\r\n4.

Confusing and irregular citations throughout the paper, you should adjust the structural paper&#39;s order and reduce the number of citations in a single paper. Writing in an irregular format and indiscriminate use of punctuation. For example, the second paragraph of section IV C. has two question marks.\r\n\r\n2. The abbreviations in the paper are confusing, some use acronyms such as LAN (Local Area Network), some do not, e.g., wide area network (WAN), the relationship between the acronym and the original term can not be understood, e.g., misclassification error (MCE), RUSBoost ( RUS-DT), AdaBoost (AD-DT), or the first appearance of the acronym without any explanation and reference, such as ISCX VPN-nonVPN, ISCX TOR-nonTOR, FAR, IDS, ENT. where TOR should be written as Tor.\r\n\r\n3. In section II B. third paragraph, authors and dates do not have to be written out after the first reference and use the bracketed number.\r\n\r\n4. In section II B, traffic detection and characterization work related to IoT-SCADA is summarized in about 10 articles, there are few references and people can not systematically understand the real level of development and potential research opportunities.\r\n\r\n5. In section III A. 2) data reconstruction paragraph, you wrote &#34;following data merging is the reconstruction of the raw network samples...&#34;. In Fig 1, the proposed benchmark dataset preprocessing shows that after the data merge is data reformation and the next step is data cleaning. what is the relationship between data reconstruction and reformation or cleaning?\r\n\r\n6. In Fig 1, we learn that you sniff and save pcap files from the proposed layered framework layer 5 IEC-60870-5-104. How do you realize this function? In section III A. 1) data merge, you specify created two scenarios datasets from public benchmark datasets, what is the relationship between the benchmark datasets and your proposed layered framework? And is the audio, browsing, chat, email, video, or VoIP network application running based on SCADA IEC-60870-5-104 communication protocol? The analysis of IOT-SCADA network communication traffic is absent.\r\n\r\n7. Why Table II and Table III contents are highly repetitive? Table III indicates it describes network traffic characterization, but has no correlation to its contents.\r\n\r\n8. Why are the values in the confusion matrix shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6 different under the condition of using the same TBA algorithm?\r\n\r\n9. Please explain why P2P class PPV only got 40.5% in Fig 10.\r\n\r\n10. In the title and abstract of the paper, you indicate that the goal of this paper is to implement anomaly detection in the IEC-60870-5-104 communication protocol based IOT-SCADA network, but there is no analysis related to traffic detection performance in this paper, and it is more focused on the classification of network traffic types, which is not in line with the central thrust of the paper.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe authors propose a TBA-based approach for the representation and detection of communication traffic in IoT-SCADA networks based on the IEC-608705-104 protocol. Several public datasets were used to benchmark the proposed TBA-based method. However, due to the following questions, I cannot recommend the acceptance of this paper in the journal. I suggest that the authors address these questions before resubmitting for consideration.\r\n1. The authors propose a method for detecting the industrial IoT protocol IEC-60870-5-104, but the two public datasets used in the experiments, ISCN VPN-nonVPN and ISCX TOR-nonTOR, do not seem to have been captured in an IIoT scenario.\r\n2. The authors use the existing traffic processing tool CICFlowmeter for the feature extraction of the traffic&#39;s temporal and spatial representations. Additionally, the ensemble learning part of the proposed TBA algorithm only seems to adopt the existing bagging technique. Thus, I think that the novelty of this paper is insufficient.\r\n3. In the standardization of data processing,  λmax and λmin are required to standardize the features to [0,1]. Does this feature processing method have any data leakage problems?\r\n4. The table on page 6, line 56 is unclear. It displays &#34;Table ??.&#34;\r\n5. The authors use ensemble learning in this paper. How are different weights allocated to each model in equation (2)? Can another set of experiments be added to compare and analyze the weight parameters?\r\n6. The paper has selected few state-of-the-art approaches for comparison, and it does not seem to have demonstrated significant advantages. Therefore, I think that the experimental results cannot prove the practical performance of the proposed method.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 4\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe authors propose a monitoring technique for detecting and characterizing the IEC-60870-5-104 IoT-SCADA network communication protocol using an anomaly detector that employs the Trees Bootstrap Aggregation (TBA) algorithm. However, the paper is lacking in some important aspects.\r\n\r\nThe research objective is not well-defined and requires further clarification on the authors&#39; aims and the importance of their research to SCADA-based critical infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIn the abstract, the authors claim early detection using TBA, but the result discussion section does not provide significant evidence of early detection.\r\n\r\nThe proposed methodology includes several modules such as dataset composition, optimization, and classification. However, the authors should explain how they merged two datasets and the implications of using two different sets of datasets.\r\n\r\nWhile hybrid IDS is generally more effective, the authors&#39; selection of datasets may not be adequate for SCADA/IoT-based systems, which rely on network and application-related parameters. In this research, the authors have only focused on network-based parameters. Please justify your approach.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the reference to the datasets is not appropriate. The authors should provide a link where readers can download the existing datasets or, if they have generated their own dataset, provide it via a GitHub link. There is also no significant discussion on the features of the datasets used in this research.\r\n\r\nThe authors illustrated in Figure 1 that datasets are originally generated in the form of pcap files, but they did not describe the module that converts pcap files to CSV files while using ML modeling.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested that the authors provide more details on the novelty/research elements and discussion on features of datasets.\r\n\r\nAE Comments:\r\nAssociate Editor\r\nComments to the Author:\r\nAccording to the reviewers&#39; comments the paper fails in fulfilling its main claim, since that analyzed data sets are not fully applicable and there is no line of argumentation substantiating on the contrary.\r\nOn the other hand the use of public data sets and the providing of performance benchmarks can be seen as an asset, hence, if the authos choose to carefully rework, they are offered the possibilkity of a resubmission. In this case, please also consider the formal aspects mentioned.", "write_date": "2023-05-15T09:09:00Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "192.168.83.14", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 481, "fields": {"subject": "P.

In this paper, the parameters of scenarios 1 and 2 (Table 2 and Table 3) were defined in the performance analysis of the proposed algorithm, but there is no parameter definition for the LOS/NLOS wireless environment. In order to analyze the performance of a more practical algorithm, it is necessary to define the parameters for this.\r\n2. In the title, it was expressed as &#34;... Algorithm&#34;, but in the case of Chapter 3, it was expressed as &#34;Proposed Localization Scheme&#34;. Please unify the terms.\r\n\r\n Reviewer_R18454\t\r\nIn this paper, the authors presented a method for localizing nodes in an industrial IoT network.\r\n(The proposed method is based on so-called wild goats algorithm which was already released in 2019.) Then, the authors evaluated the proposed method by using a simulation method.\r\nLocalization in IoT networks is an issue of interest.\r\nFor the publication of this paper, however, it is recommended to revise the paper with reference to the comments below.\r\n- Wild goats algorithm is a core of the proposed method.\r\nHowever, the algorithm is never stated in the introduction.\r\nThe algorithm should be addressed in detail in the introduction.\r\n- In the 2nd scenario presumed for the simulation, no explanation is made on the locations of nodes.\r\nIn each simulation, it is highly recommended to determine such locations independently and randomly as well.\r\n- In scenarios 1 and 2, communication ranges are set to 100 meter and 25 meters, respectively.\r\nHowever, the standard deviations of distance measurement are commonly set to 1 meter.\r\nIt is needed to justify how such settings are possible in practice.\r\n- There are some typos, which should be corrected.\r\n- In the introduction, a full description of industrial IoT should be made.", "write_date": "2023-05-22T11:39:01Z", "update_date": "2023-06-08T15:57:10Z", "tcp_ip": "", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 482, "fields": {"subject": "Ali Aouto, Ali Moallem, and Dong-Seong Kim, &#34;Hybrid Demand Responsive Public Transport System for Conventional Public Transport in City Metropolitan Area&#34; KICS journal", "content": "Dear Authors,\r\n\r\nThe first round of review has been completed.\r\nFirst of all, thank you for considering KICS Journal to publish your research results.\r\nAlthough reviewers have concerns about the manuscript, the comments are not too serious.

State-of-the-art needs a lot of work.  Authors should do conduct more research to understand the state-of-the-art and present their work relative to the state-of-the-art.  They will have to clearly bring out their contributions after assessing the need for such contributions.  Authors should improve their references and bring the state-of-the-art into the paper.  Authors should compare their contributions with the state-of-the-art and present the drawbacks and advantages in their work.  They need to develop a good structure for representing their work and at all times asking the following questions:  Why should this work be published, what aspects of existing knowledge does it improve, does it provide new knowledge and how is this  new knowledge going to improve the area of research in consumer technology?  Further, authors should also enquire if their approach is thorough.  Once authors&#39; pear down their work in this fashion, they would be able to see gaps in their current presentation and improve the work.\r\n\r\nReviewer(s)&#39; Comments to Author:\r\n\r\nReviewer: 1\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThank you for submitting your paper to IEEE Trans Consumer Electronics. Lets go down the paper:\r\n\r\n1) The title makes no sense, what is &#34;nano&#34;? What is the novel step the authors are proposing?\r\n\r\n2) The abstract says nothing about consumer electronics and what relevance the work has to consumer electronics.\r\n\r\n3) Commercial - Arduino, Intel, Figure 1, SEN0348,  Android, and many of the figures, The instructions clearly states to avoid all commercialism. It makes no sense as mass market CE systems would not use such systems.\r\n\r\n4) The large character at the start of the Introduction is missing.\r\n\r\n5) Looking at the novel contributions:\r\n1) &#34; Proposes a key storage system by implementing an IoT device, Arduino Nano, as hardware storage&#34; - mass market CE systems would not do that. It would have been better for the authors to be more hardware agnostic.\r\n2) &#34;The proposed system can assure the security of the private key, even though the device is missing, as the only way to retrieve the key is using the owner’s fingerprint&#34; - but that is the point, and is not novel as many systems already require fingerprint access to retrieve.\r\n3) &#34;A private key can be linked to multiple fingerprints, making it possible to the user’s legacy to inherit the key from the previous owner&#34; - is already known.\r\n\r\n4) Poor citation style, &#34;As mentioned in [3], there &#34;\r\n\r\n5) Poor citation style, &#34;. Paper [4] presented a&#34;\r\n\r\n6) Poor citation style, &#34;Research in [2] proposed&#34;\r\n\r\n7) Poor citation style, &#34;Article [5] has proposed&#34;\r\n\r\n8) Poor citation style, &#34;A study in [1] proposed&#34;\r\n\r\netc. Please cite correctly.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the paper, the authors have constructed an Arduino key storage device. Such devices are already on the market and the presented work is fundamentally not new.\r\n\r\nIt is rather strange, and perhaps describes the reason, the authors seem unaware of the current state of cryptography systems in the consumer research field. The authors do not cite or use any of the past research in the consumer field. If they had, they perhaps would have seen that what is presented is just not new or state of the art.\r\n\r\nHaving just 12 references in an IEEE Transactions paper these days clearly does not cover the state of the art.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThe core of the manuscript,  Blockchain Private Key Storage System using Nano IoT is an interesting topic for a broad audience, as it would trigger research from different areas. The paper concept is impressive, and this research work’s novelty is significant.

In order to solve the problem, a discrete bio-inspired algorithm is proposed. Regarding the technical details of this manuscript, several major concerns are raised and listed as follows:\r\nIn real-world scenarios, carrier robots require energy consumption during the execution of tasks and the battery capacity of each robot may vary in real-world scenarios. Do the authors need to consider the energy consumption constraint to prevent the robots from stopping prematurely due to low battery levels.\r\nIn section IV, the authors proposed the task insertion algorithm which is designed based on DPSO algorithm as the main part, however the definition of F_(g,e) is not clear.\r\nIn section V, the proposed method is compared with some special cases of the proposed method. In this case, it is straightforward that the proposed method outperforms those methods. In other words, authors may further compare their method with some other methods to show the significance of their method.\r\nSome latest studies about edge computing and task provisioning are missed in the related work, the authors need to add them and analyze the difference, e.g., Joint Optimization of Computing Offloading and Service Caching in Edge Computing-based Smart Grid, IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing; Reverse Auction-based Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation in Mobile Cloud-Edge Computing, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing; UAV-aided Computation Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing Networks: A Stackelberg Game Approach, IEEE Internet of Things Journal.\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1) Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: yes\r\n\r\n2) Is the paper technically sound?: yes\r\n\r\n3) Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: yes\r\n\r\n4) Are the references provided applicable and sufficient?: yes\r\n\r\n5) Are there references that are not appropriate for the topic being discussed?: Yes\r\n\r\n5a) If yes, then please indicate which references should be removed.:\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nRecommendation: Accept (minor edits)\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nThis manuscript introduces a pickup and delivery task provisioning and vehicle routing framework for carrier robots in a factory with edge servers assisting as the intermediary\r\nbetween robots and working stations, where the task requests come. The carrier robots must pick up and deliver each assigned load from and to designated locations with minimal traveled distance and without violating designated constraints. Edge servers are utilized to facilitate communication between the main server and delivery robots and assist the main server in deciding the best robot for each incoming task request and the updated route to facilitate the execution of tasks by each carrier robot.\r\nOverall the manuscript is well-written and well-organized, and most importantly it is technically sound.\r\nI have just a few minor comments:\r\n-elaborate on how the parameters in Table 1 were chosen\r\n-the text size is very small in Figure 5-10, which makes it difficult to read.\r\n- some related works are missing:\r\n[1] Cai, Xiaofeng, et al. &#34;Robot and its living space: A roadmap for robot development based on the view of living space.&#34; Digital Communications and Networks (2020).\r\n[2] Contini, Antonello, and Alessandro Farinelli. &#34;Coordination approaches for multi-item pickup and delivery in logistic scenarios.&#34; Robotics and Autonomous Systems 146 (2021): 103871.\r\n[3] Wang, Wenxi, et al. &#34;A Survey of Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence for Social Computing.&#34; IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems 52.3 (2021): 468-480.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Questions:\r\n1) Does the paper contribute to the body of knowledge?: yes\r\n\r\n2) Is the paper technically sound?: yes\r\n\r\n3) Is the subject matter presented in a comprehensive manner?: yes\r\n\r\n4) Are the references provided applicable and sufficient?: yes\r\n\r\n5) Are there references that are not appropriate for the topic being discussed?: No\r\n\r\n5a) If yes, then please indicate which references should be removed.:", "write_date": "2023-05-26T13:24:30Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "192.168.83.4", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 488, "fields": {"subject": "Urslla Uchechi Izuazu, Nwakanma Cosmas Ifeanyi , Dong-Seong Kim,  Jae-Min Lee; Deep Learning-based Aberrant  Intrusion Detection Framework for Internet of VR Things (IoVR): Towards a Secured Metaverse;.

Proposed a deep learning-based aberrant intrusion detection framework specifically designed for the Internet of VR Things (IoVR) environment.\r\n2. Introduced a novel approach to detect and classify network attacks in the IoVR system, addressing the unique security challenges in the context of virtual reality.\r\n3. Utilized deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to learn and classify anomalous traffic patterns in real-time.\r\n4. Evaluated the proposed framework using a comprehensive dataset and demonstrated its effectiveness in accurately identifying network attacks while minimizing false positives.\r\n5. Provided insights into the performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, showcasing the model&#39;s robustness and potential for real-world deployment in securing the IoVR ecosystem.\r\nLogical Comments:\r\n\r\n&#8226; Lack of Comparative Analysis: The paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing intrusion detection frameworks in the context of the IoVR environment. A comparative study could provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed framework compared to other state-of-the-art solutions.\r\n&#8226; Limited Evaluation Metrics: While the paper highlights accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as performance metrics, additional metrics such as false positive rate, false negative rate, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed framework&#39;s effectiveness.\r\n&#8226; Insufficient Discussion on Dataset Selection: The paper does not provide detailed justification or analysis regarding the selection of the dataset used for evaluation. A thorough discussion on the dataset&#39;s representativeness, diversity, and relevance to the IoVR environment is necessary to establish the credibility and generalizability of the results.\r\n&#8226; Lack of Real-world Implementation Considerations: The paper lacks a discussion on the practical implementation aspects of the proposed framework in real-world IoVR scenarios. Factors such as resource constraints, scalability, deployment challenges, and integration with existing IoVR systems should be addressed to assess the feasibility and applicability of the framework.\r\n&#8226; Inadequate Comparison of Deep Learning Models: The paper briefly mentions the utilization of both CNNs and RNNs in the proposed framework, but there is limited analysis on the advantages and limitations of each model in the context of IoVR intrusion detection. A more detailed comparison and justification for the selection of these specific deep learning architectures would strengthen the paper&#39;s contribution.\r\n&#8226; Limited Insights into Training and Optimization Techniques: The paper lacks comprehensive details on the training procedures, hyperparameter optimization, and convergence criteria employed for the deep learning models. Providing insights into these aspects would enable better reproducibility and understanding of the proposed framework.\r\n&#8226; Lack of Discussion on False Positive and False Negative Analysis: The paper does not sufficiently address the impact of false positives and false negatives on the proposed framework&#39;s performance. These errors play a crucial role in real-world deployment and should be thoroughly discussed, along with potential mitigation strategies.\r\n&#8226; Limited Future Work Discussion: Although the paper briefly mentions future work, it lacks a concrete plan for addressing the identified limitations and potential directions for further research in the field of aberrant intrusion detection in the IoVR domain.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\n1. The paper begins by mentioning that the hidden layer was artificially assigned 10 neurons after trying out different numbers of neurons. It would be helpful to provide more insight into the process of selecting the number of neurons and why 10 was chosen.\r\n\r\n2. The trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency is mentioned when increasing the number of layers. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the specific trade-offs observed in this research and provide quantitative data on the impact of increasing layers on accuracy and computational time.\r\n\r\n3. The concept of &#34;layer pruning&#34; is introduced as a way to improve computational efficiency. It would be useful to explain the criteria used for removing two layers from the model and how this decision was made. Additionally, more details on the resulting accuracy after layer pruning would provide a clearer understanding of the model&#39;s performance.\r\n\r\n4. The description of the model&#39;s architecture and the use of rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function and softmax activation function is clear and informative. However, it would be beneficial to provide more details on why these specific activation functions were chosen and their impact on the model&#39;s performance.\r\n\r\n5. The mathematical expression (equation 1) representing the artificial neural network logic is provided. It would be helpful to explain the significance of each component of the equation and how it relates to the model&#39;s decision-making process.[since DNN used in this work it would be better to  providing related equation will be good, instead of just ANN]\r\n\r\n6. The paper introduces the IoVR architecture and the importance of security measures in IoVR applications. It would be useful to provide more details on how the proposed model contributes to enhancing security in the IoVR architecture and how it addresses specific security challenges.\r\n\r\n7. The defense framework presented in the paper is briefly described. It would be beneficial to provide more details on how the framework operates, what types of attacks it can detect, and how it ensures the security of user data.\r\n\r\n8. The paper mentions the use of AI-driven security systems and deep learning (DL) methods. It would be helpful to provide more information on how DL methods, specifically the proposed AI/DL-based framework, outperform traditional machine learning methods in detecting aberrations in the IoVR network architecture.\r\n\r\n9. The use of the CIC-IDS2017 dataset for training the model is mentioned. It would be beneficial to explain why this dataset was chosen, its relevance to IoVR security, and any limitations or challenges encountered while using this dataset.\r\n---\r\n\r\nOther comments\r\nProvide more detailed explanations and justifications for the choices made in the research, such as the selection of the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the activation functions used.\r\n\r\nInclude more quantitative data and analysis to support the claims made in the paper, particularly regarding the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, the impact of layer pruning, and the performance of the proposed model.\r\n\r\nExpand on the description of the proposed defense framework, providing more details on its operation, detection capabilities, and how it integrates with the IoVR architecture.\r\n\r\nClarify the contributions of the proposed AI/DL-based framework compared to other existing methods, highlighting specific advantages and improvements.\r\n\r\nDiscuss the limitations and potential challenges of the research, addressing issues such as dataset limitations, scalability, and potential real-world implementation challenges.\r\n\r\nInclude visuals, such as figures and diagrams, to enhance the understanding of the proposed model, the IoVR architecture, and the performance evaluation results.\r\n\r\nConsider providing insights into future research directions, potential extensions to the proposed framework, and areas where further improvements can be made.\r\n\r\nProofread the paper for grammar, clarity, and coherence to ensure the ideas are effectively communicated to&#39;\r\n\r\n\r\nProvide a more detailed explanation of the feature selection and dimensionality reduction process. Elaborate on the criteria used to select the prominent features and how they contribute to improving the model&#39;s performance. Additionally, discuss any challenges or considerations encountered during the feature selection process.\r\n\r\nInclude a more comprehensive analysis of the dataset, such as visualisations or statistical insights, to better understand the underlying patterns and structures. This analysis can help in justifying the choices made in the model architecture and provide additional insights into the dataset&#39;s characteristics.\r\n\r\nDiscuss the generalisation capabilities of the proposed model. How well does it perform on unseen data or data from different sources? Address the potential limitations and challenges related to generalisation and suggest approaches to overcome them.\r\n\r\nProvide more details on the hyperparameters used in the model training.

It is recommended to correct the ordering. \r\n- The proposed PoUW framework lacks an explanation of how and why VRP is used: it is rather described with much detail in Section I Introduction. It would be more appropriate to include some related information in Section III rather than in the Introduction. This will provide readers with a clear understanding of how VRP relates to the proposed framework. \r\n- The manuscript does not sufficiently explain how considering and solving VRP benefits the PoUW framework, compared to the other PoUW works that consider different problems. It is important to provide a comprehensive explanation of the advantages of using VRP in the context of PoUW. Especially, it would be beneficial to provide a comparison with other baselines PoUW that adopts different problems (not VRP). \r\n- The simulation scenario only considers a single problem pooling node and a single external party node. It would be better to explore the results with multiple nodes, providing insights into the scalability and performance of the proposed approach in more complex scenarios. \r\n- The manuscript introduces (in Section IV) the concept of a usefulness rate but lacks a clear definition of what &#34;useful work&#34; entails.

In addition to minor grammar and style errors, the manuscript exhibits numerous structural issues that must be addressed. These problems range from the lack of a clear contribution to the existing state of the art to deficiencies in the organization and presentation of the content, as well as shortcomings in the analysis of the results.\r\n\r\nGuest Editor: Jammal, Manar\r\nComments to the Author:\r\nThe paper needs to better discuss their work in comparison to the existing literature. It is crucial to highlight the novelty of their approach and the significance of their findings in relation to previous research.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is claimed that this work can be generalized to Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, this claim is not adequately substantiated in the paper. I suggest that the authors provide a more detailed discussion of how their findings and methodology can be applied to IoT applications, including potential challenges and limitations.\r\nFinally, there are concerns regarding the paper&#39;s evaluation and accuracy. The authors should reassess their methodology and results.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 1\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\n1. What exactly is the new contribution of the proposed LIME? I do not see any concepts that were not mentioned in the literature.\r\n2. From Fig. 2 to Fig. 5, I do not see which part is LIME. Fig. 5 visualizes the decision tree in a global manner. Where is the local model-agnostic explanation?\r\n3. Examining an IIoT dataset does not generalize the work to be applicable to all IIoT cases.\r\n4. Maybe the first thing to explain is why a simple decision tree can achieve 100% accuracy. The dataset should be examined first. Is the dataset contaminated? That is, some features leak the classification information. It only happens in the dataset, not in the real world.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis paper proposed a decision tree XAI framework to identify real-time IoT attacks. The proposed framework introduces more trust and transparency in the ML based-IDS and the personnel executing its decisions. In general, this is an interesting paper but is not solid enough in the current state. The followings are some comments:\r\n\r\n1. The contribution of the proposed approach in the Introduction section is not well defined. Authors should clearly explain contributions of this study.\r\n2.

However, the study, as it currently stands, leaves room for improvements and refinement. Here are a few observations and suggestions:\r\n\r\nThe unique value contributions of the proposed method are inadequately defined. It is recommended that the authors pinpoint the distinct contributions of this research.\r\nThe authors need to explain the novelty of such work given it already exists in the literature ref [10].\r\n\r\nThe evaluation section is not explained and it seems that there are issues with data, confusion matrix is not explained and the accuracy of 100% is not justified.\r\nThe applicability/feasibility of this work on different IoT applications is not clear, the authors claimed it can be generalized, but it is not clear how.\r\n\r\nLastly, the readability and linguistic precision of the paper require enhancement.\r\nDate Sent:\t22-May-2023", "write_date": "2023-06-14T08:55:38Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "192.168.83.14", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 491, "fields": {"subject": "Ahmad Zainudin, Made Adi Paramartha Putra, Dong-Seong Kim, Jae-Min Lee,&#34;Federated Learning-Assisted Human Activity Recognition for Interactive Avatar in Metaverse&#34;,IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications,2023 (Rejected)", "content": "[JSAC-SI-HCM 2024] Notification of review result on your paper #1570895016 (&#39;Federated Learning-Assisted Human Activity Recognition for Interactive Avatar in Metaverse&#39;)\r\n\r\nDear Ahmad Zainudin, Made Adi Paramartha Putra, Dong Seong Kim and Jae Min Lee,\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting your paper to the IEEE JSAC Special Issue on Human-Centric Communication and Networking for Metaverse over 5G and Beyond Networks.\r\n\r\nWe have received a very large number of submissions, many of which were of extremely high quality.

Some references are not convincing enough, please cite some high-quality references to improve the manuscript.\r\n\r\n2. To the best of my knowledge, CNN-LSTM model is outdated and some state-of-the-art works are not mentioned in this paper. Hence, the experiments are not solid and convincing.\r\n\r\n3. The motivation of adopting federated learning in proposed scenario is indefensible, I do not make sense the necessity of privacy protection in HAR. Besides, the experiments do not illustrate advantages of proposed framework on the communication overheads.\r\n\r\n4. In section V, a typo in the second line from the bottom: “MFLPOs” should be corrected to “MFLOPs”.\r\n\r\n5. In section II.A, this paper mentions the reference [17] utilized the LSTM-GRU. This is a confusing issue, in fact, there is no essential difference between LSTM and GRU. Hence, the combination of these two models is baseless. It is necessary to check the quality of references more precisely.\r\n\r\n6. In section II.A, this paper mentions the reference [9] leverages the MLP, however, I do not find MLP is adopted in reference [9]. Besides, the MLP is over simple and cannot be a comparison in experiments, therefore, the objectivity of the experiments is questionable.\r\n\r\n7. The DNN is the abbreviation of deep neural network, hence, the comparisons between DNN and proposed AvatarNet is absurd in experiments. I advise authors to substantially revise this manuscript and provide more robust evidence to support the ideas.\r\n\r\n8.

The article seems to have been repeating the comparison with existing methods. In addition to the Section II, a lot of space has been devoted to describing the problems of existing methods in the introduction and even the problem formulation. However, even so, it is still not described clearly. For example, [7] also uses infrared array sensors. Why is it classified as &#34;adapted limited types of activities&#34; and what is the difference between it and this paper?\r\n2. The experimental part and text description are confusing, i.e., &#34;the three highest performing clients are selected for the next 10 communication rounds&#34;, both want to indicate that client selection should be executed once every 10 rounds, but the code means that except for round one and tens, all other rounds need to do it.\r\n3. The symbol usage of P_ {min} is confusing. The input of Algorithm 2 should be the number of selected clients, and the output should be the selected set. (Line 6 of Algorithm 1)\r\n4. Acc-based client selection is a common practice, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s new. Moreover, It needs to calculate the accuracy of each client in every round, which will take a lot of time. Authors should do an experiment on latency.\r\n5. What does &#34;2 local training rounds and 100 communication rounds&#34; mean ? It means to aggregate the model after two local updates? Additionally, it is not clear what the value of local epoch ε is.\r\n6. There&#39;re insufficient explanation of the results in Figure 5. Why is the random algorithm better than the first two algorithms?\r\n7. The effect of MetaFi [4] is good, and the article emphasizes its high complexity, so it should be compared as a baseline.\r\n\r\n> *** Negatives: What are the most important reasons NOT to accept this paper, in order of importance?

The paper explains the approach and background clearly, and demonstrates the data is organized well, thus well written.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n* The approach of union-feature selection does not seem to have much relationship with Metaverse. Is there any reason that it is not a general approach? Or is there any reason that we should not generalize the approach to a broader class of classification problems? What&#39;s the downside of this union of features, in general?\r\n* This is purely an empirical study, as a research paper, if the focus is on algorithms, then we need to theoretically analyze why the new approach is better than those alone and thoroughly understand the pros and cons. If the focus is on domain specific questions, then there would be expectation on more involved domain-specific analysis. But it seems the paper is not focusing on either, instead, it is a hypothesized idea with experiment data on limited dataset without thorough theoretical analysis nor strong domain specific technical explanation. This results in the paper to lack intellectual contribution or novelty.\r\n* The paper pointed out the proposed approach is better than PCC/DT alone. But there is no context about how much better is great work, i.e., is the improvement really amazing or just a mediocre tweak, we do not know, and the paper did not cover the significance of the result improvement.\r\n* The creation of F4 is very difficult to understand, why would one union the features that being excluded from PCC **and** DT? What&#39;s the reasoning behind this?\r\n\r\nNits:\r\nPage-1,  SIEM is not Security Information and Identify Management\r\nThe paper mentions filter and wrapper.

Though the topic is interesting, the methods proposed are very simple and will lead to increased time complexity. The classification accuracy of more than  93.1% has been achieved in many machine learning-based approaches. Even deep learning-based solutions with better accuracy and reduced time complexity are available. Hence, the work can be tried with deep learning based approach.\r\n\r\nAssociate Editor\r\nComments to the Author:\r\nBased on the reviews received, there are some major issues with this submission, including 1) the approach of union-feature selection does not seem to have much relationship with Metaverse; 2)\r\nthe results in the paper lack intellectual contribution or novelty; and 3) the approach is simple and will lead to increased time complexity.

I, therefore, do not have any more comments. Thank you.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThanks to the author&#39;s response and modification, many mistakes have been corrected. However, I remain skeptical about the structure and feasibility of the experiment in Fig 1. Fig 1 indicates that is a pipeline illustration or flowchart in a conceptualized layered IoT-SCADA IEC-60870-5-104 protocol network. How can we understand this concept? You were using many public datasets including CIC-Darknet2020, CMU-SYNTRAFFIC-2022, and WUSTL-IIOT-2021.  In section I study focus 2), you wrote: &#34;To demonstrate an intelligent solution capable of monitoring for distinguishing different types of IoT-SCADA IEC-104 communication protocol encrypted network traffic in a stream of specific network activity.&#34; In section III, you specify &#34;The study features the conceptual monitoring of layered IoT-SCADA network architecture with IEC-104 communication protocol....&#34;. In section IV A Dataset description, you wrote &#34;.......which are consistent data features of the IoT-SCADA network traffic in addition to specific sensor data&#34;.  Combining your previous statements, we can learn that you&#39;re modeling or approximating the conceptual framework you&#39;re proposing with a lot of public datasets. But those datasets don&#39;t have anything to do with the IoT-SCADA IEC-60870-5-104 protocol network, and their simulation scenarios didn&#39;t use that protocol, although some of them use IIoT and industrial scenarios, the direct equivalence is unconvincing. You need to justify why the datasets you are using and the concepts you are proposing apply to each other, more details need to be provided. Otherwise, you will need to perform simulations for the IoT-SCADA IEC-60870-5-104 communication protocol, generate simulated traffic, or capture traffic in a real-world layered IOT-SCADA network.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\n1.

Concise and very objective.\r\nRelated works\r\n- Adequate\r\nMethodology\r\n- Adequate\r\nSimulation Results and Discussion\r\n- I doubt on the accuracy\r\no How accurate is the technique? I would suggest that the technique has to be tested using different sets of data. Fabricate/experiment and compare with simulated/calculated results.\r\nConclusion\r\n- Adequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer #2:\r\nIn this article, the authors evaluated the time efficiency of 1-D kernel CNN for predicting Smart grid frequency stability. Although good numerical results have been obtained, there are concerns related to how the model is designed and verified. Therefore, it is necessary for the authors to consider the following\r\n1. The main idea cannot be taken from the contributions of the introduction section.\r\n2. The references are not up-to-date, there is no review of the 2022 and 2023 articles.\r\n3. Why is computational cost important in mentioned scope? If the strength of the proposed method is computing time management, it should be addressed more. In the introduction of related methods, the strengths and weaknesses should be briefly mentioned.\r\n4. Why is computational cost important in the training phase and what is its impact in real-time when model can train on dataset in offline phase? It is better to compare the number of optimal parameters in the investigated models.\r\n5. The difference between the time of the proposed method and other methods is very large. Explain the reason theoretically. What is a main trade-off? Explain the reason theoretically. What is a trade-off? It should be verified in more detail. Authors should prove the superiority of their work with more experiments.\r\n6. What is the dash symbol in the table 2? The Computational Time-cost of all models in Table 6 should be include for fair comparison (specially CNN).\r\n7. In Table 6, indexes are not done (a-c). How the data set was divided into Train-Validation-Test sets?\r\n8. For a more accurate evaluation, comparison with other methods, especially recent methods, should be added to the text in more detail.\r\n9. The algorithm of the proposed method should be added to the text as pseudo code.\r\n10. In what process are the parameters of the optimal model set? The choice of hyperparameters has a direct effect on the performance of the final model.

They both pointed out the novelty and contribution should be better summarized and the proposed algorithm should be fairly compared with existing intelligent algorithms, such as GA and PSO. Based on my own reading, I agreed with the them and thereby invite you to revise your manuscript according to the detailed comments from the reviewers.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer(s)&#39; Comments to Author:\r\n\r\nReviewer: 1\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nIn this paper, the authors propose a new PAPR reduction strategy called whale optimization algorithm-based partial transmit sequence (WOA-PTS) to reduce the PAPR of universal filtered multicarrier (UFMC) system. Due to its interesting topic, the paper has the potential to be considered for publication in this journal. However, some changes are required in the paper to be accepted for publication.\r\n1. Please give the main contributions of the paper as a list in the Introduction Section.\r\n2. The paper should be reviewed by a professional language expert. There are many grammatical and syntax errors.\r\n3. In the paper, please clearly explain the reason of choosing the whale optimization algorithm for PAPR reduction in the UFMC system. What are the unique features and superiorities of WOA over the other intelligent optimization algorithms?\r\n4. The computational complexity analysis of each technique must be carried out by expressing their computational loads in terms of the number of multiplications and the number of additions needed throughout the PAPR reduction process.  \r\n5. Apart from the classical PTS and IWO-PTS, please add at least two more intelligent optimization algorithm-based PTS strategy for comparison to clearly demonstrate the efficiency of WOA-PTS proposed in this paper.\r\n6. Please compare the convergence performance of the considered optimization algorithms by obtaining the convergence graph of each one.\r\n7. Please use Monte Carlo method in the simulations to acquire smoother PAPR curves with minimal fractures. Besides, please obtain the PAPR curves for at least CCDF=10^-3.\r\n8. Bit error rate (BER) performance of the considered PAPR reduction methods under the usage of nonlinear high power amplifier (HPA) is missing.\r\n9. The figure resolutions are insufficient, which reduces the paper quality.\r\n10. There is a problem with the PSD performance comparison in Figure 4. The PSD improvement must be acquired in the side lobes, not at the top of the PSD graph. You should obtain the PSD curve of each strategy under the usage of nonlinear high power amplifier (HPA) to be able to demonstrate the amount of suppression achieved by each technique on the side lobes of UFMC waveform. We cannot see any side lobe suppression in the Figure 4. So please revise the codes and repeat the simulations to obtain more accurate results in Figure 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nThis letter proposes a Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)-based Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) scheme, named WOA-PTS, for reducing the high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) in Universal Filtered Multi-Carrier (UFMC) systems. The application of PTS-based PAPR reduction with heuristic algorithms like Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been extensively studied. However, this letter is considered lacking in contribution and novelty. The detailed comments are as follows:\r\n\r\n-Section 2.2 should provide more details about the PTS technique.\r\n\r\n-The author should also present the PTS-OFDM scheme in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\n-Can the author compare the proposed scheme with GA or PSO-based optimization?\r\n\r\n-It would be interesting to analyze the performance loss of the proposed scheme.\r\n\r\n-There is room for improvement in terms of content and clarity, especially in section (10).", "write_date": "2023-09-12T16:34:28Z", "update_date": "2024-03-19T16:31:27Z", "tcp_ip": "192.168.83.128", "writer": 1}}, {"model": "works.review", "pk": 496, "fields": {"subject": "Made Adi Paramartha Putra, Ahmad Zainudin, Revin Naufal Alief, Dong-Seong Kim, and Jae-Min Lee, &#34;PureFed: An Efficient Collaborative and Trustworthy Blockchain-Assisted Federated Learning Framework&#34;, IEEE IoT Journal, 2023 (Reject)", "content": "17-Nov-2023\r\n\r\nPaper: IoT-32520-2023 PureFed: An Efficient Collaborative and Trustworthy Blockchain-Assisted Federated Learning Framework\r\nAuthors:  Prof. Jae-Min Lee, Putra, Made Adi Paramartha; Zainudin, Ahmad; Alief, Revin; Kim, Dong-Seong; Lee, Jae-Min\r\nEditor: Prof. Ruidong Li\r\n\r\nDear Prof. Lee,\r\n\r\nI am writing to you concerning the above-referenced manuscript, which you submitted to the IEEE Internet of Things Journal.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has merit, based on the enclosed set of reviews this manuscript has been rejected for publication in the IEEE Internet of Things Journal.\r\n\r\nYou may wish to consider the comments of the reviewers and submit it to another journal.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding the reviews, please contact the Associate Editor: Prof. Ruidong Li liruidong@ieee.org.

In particular, it employs smart contracts (blockchain technology) to enhance the security of the framework by using symmetric key encryption and dual digital signature mechanisms using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). A dynamic aggregation scheme from 3 methods and dynamic incentive, as well as punishment mechanisms, are also used. To this end, the reviewer has major concerns as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The main concern is the application of this paper. This journal specializes in IoT systems, however, the reviewer does not see any IoT explanation in this manuscript. Please justify.\r\n\r\n2. In the Abstract, there are several information related to the contributions. However, they need to be smoothly written. Please make the contributions coherent. Additionally, the authors should highlight the most important contributions among them both in the Abstract and Section I.\r\n\r\n3. Additionally, the authors are encouraged to provide the motivations and background related to problems of using IoT systems.\r\n\r\n4. The current writing structure of Section I seems confusing, incoherent, and too long. Please revise Section I and make it concise.\r\n\r\n5. Section III. A explains Problem Formulation. However, the reviewer does not see any equations or formulations in this Section. Please revise.\r\n\r\n6. Upon the equation, if the sentence continues, it should use a comma not a dot. Please check all equation parts.\r\n\r\n7. The authors utilize dynamic aggregation schemes with 3 methods. Nonetheless, the authors do not explain in which conditions each method will apply and provide the best model performance.\r\n\r\n8. It seems that the reward and punishment mechanisms are not an optimization problem, thus hindering the contribution of this mechanism. Please clarify the importance of such a mechanism.\r\n\r\n9. It is very common for researchers to use a standard dataset, i.e., MNIST, to show the efficacy of their proposed frameworks. To this end, the authors are encouraged to provide one more IoT-related dataset.\r\n\r\n10. The authors are encouraged to provide/explain the utilized neural networks and main hyperparameter settings for the FL implementation, e.g., learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc.\r\n\r\n11. In the Abstract, the authors mention the comparative simulations. However, the reviewer does not see any accuracy or loss comparison with other baseline methods, e.g., conventional FL or other FL methods.\r\n\r\n12. The number of references is insufficient. Please add more relevant references, e.g., up to 35-40 references.\r\n\r\nReviewer: 2\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nReviewer: 3\r\n\r\nComments to the Author\r\n1. The author proposed a federated learning framework and verified its performance using the MNIST dataset. What machine learning method did the author use to classify handwriting data? What is the performance of the proposed framework in processing time series data, which has different type of MNIST dataset? In order to more fully illustrate the performance of the proposed framework, it is recommended to increase the type and number of data sets in the experimental part.\r\n\r\n2. In the reward distribution represented by formulas (3)-(5), it seems that only the performance of accuracy is considered? Why not consider other performance, such as precision and recall?\r\n\r\n3. In the paper, the author describes the performance of each part of the proposed framework in great detail, but the description of the performance of the entire framework is insufficient. Therefore, it is recommended to add descriptions about the performance of the overall framework, including computing overhead, operation time, etc.\r\n\r\n4. In this paper, the LM method is compared many times. Please note that the full name of LM is not given. Furthermore, adding contrasting methods, not just LM, would be better practice.\r\n\r\n5. In the Table II, the Loss-based scheme achieves the best precision, recall and F1 score while taking the least time. why is that? At the same time, compared with the schemes based on FedAvg and Accuracy, the performance of the proposed method is doubled and the time is also shortened by half. Why is this? A kind reminder, it will help readers&#39; understanding if relevant references for schemes based on FedAvg, Accuracy and Loss are given.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: If any of the reviews include an additional attached file, it will not be attached to this message.
