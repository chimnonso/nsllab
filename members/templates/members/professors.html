For 24 years, I have developed real-time embedded SW technologies used in military and industrial applications, contributing to the localization of domestic defense technology. This venture has produced over 160 people with master's and doctoral degrees, significantly contributing to nurturing high-quality human resources in related fields. He founded the NSLab. Co., LTD, a startup company based on Networked Systems Lab. His goal was to establish a company that could capitalize on the research and technological development he had accumulated while working as a professor for over 24 years. We present a model with a virtuous cycle structure that encourages an environment where master's and doctoral student researchers can advance their research  and monetize the research results obtained through this to grow the company and hire qualified researchers. The driving force behind his ability to start a startup was the research infrastructure and the researchers he had produced. </p>
